  @moduledoc """
  Runs Dialyzer in OTP's incremental mode.

      $ mix dialyzer.incremental
      $ mix dialyzer.incremental --metrics-file /tmp/iplt-metrics.txt

  This is what `mix precommit` and both CI workflows run. `mix dialyzer` is
  unchanged and stays available as the cross-check to reach for when a warning
  here looks wrong; see *Warning parity* below for what the two were compared
  on.

  ## Why

  A classic PLT is cached wholesale. Dialyxir decides whether to re-check it by
  hashing `mix.lock` plus the application list
  (`Mix.Tasks.Dialyzer.dependency_hash/0`), and when that hash moves it
  re-verifies *every* module in the PLT rather than the ones that changed.
  Building one from scratch measured 589s here, and over an hour in a project
  that consumes this one as a path dependency.

  That trigger is also blind in one direction: a path dependency's source
  changes move neither `mix.lock` nor the application list, so a consuming
  project's PLT silently keeps stale typings for it. Working around that means
  invalidating dialyxir's hash by hand, which restores correctness at the cost
  of a full re-verification on every edit to the dependency.

  An incremental PLT tracks per-module hashes itself and re-analyses only what
  changed, which is exactly the missing capability. Measured against a
  one-module edit, `--metrics-file` reported one module of 4475 re-analysed.

  End to end, with nothing changed since the previous run: 78.7s against 4.5s
  in Core, and 451.8s against 12.0s in the repo that consumes Core as a path
  dependency, where the classic PLT is invalidated by every Core commit. A
  change big enough to move 312 of that repo's modules at once still came in at
  173s.

  ## Why a separate task rather than a flag on `mix dialyzer`

  Dialyxir cannot reach incremental mode: `Mix.Tasks.Dialyzer` builds a fixed
  argument list, and its passthrough for unrecognised arguments feeds them to
  dialyzer as *warning* options, while `--incremental` is an analysis type.

  Its runner, though, splits off only its own five keys and hands everything
  else to `:dialyzer.run/1` verbatim, and `run/1` returns the same warning list
  in incremental mode as in classic mode. So calling `Dialyxir.Dialyzer.dialyze/1`
  with the extra options keeps dialyxir's Elixir-shaped formatting,
  `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` filtering and unused-filter reporting, none of which
  has to be reimplemented here.

  ## Warning parity

  Adoption was gated on the two modes reporting the same warnings, because the
  filters in `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` are matched against whatever is reported: if
  incremental mode reported even slightly differently, those filters would go
  stale and `list_unused_filters` would start failing the gate for reasons
  unrelated to the code under analysis.

  They agree. On a clean tree both report the same error and skip counts in each
  repo, with no unused filters; against a deliberately mismatched `@spec` both
  produce byte-identical warning text and the same exit status. Re-check with a
  plain diff of the two outputs if a warning here ever looks like an artefact of
  the mode rather than a fact about the code.

  `--metrics-file` (incremental mode only) reports how much was skipped, which
  is how to confirm the incrementality is real rather than assumed.

  ## Options

    * `--metrics-file FILE` - write incrementality metrics to FILE
    * `--list-unused-filters` - fail when `.dialyzer_ignore.exs` has entries
      that matched nothing, mirroring the classic task's option of the same name
    * `--ignore-exit-status` - always exit 0

  # Incremental mode has no separate PLT-building step. Where the classic task

  # Passing only the project's own beams (`{:files, dialyzer_files()}`, which is
