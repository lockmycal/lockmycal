defmodule TymeslotWeb.Helpers.ClientIP do
  @moduledoc """
  Provides a standardized way to extract client IP addresses from both
  Plug.Conn (for controllers) and Phoenix.LiveView.Socket (for LiveViews).

  Handles various scenarios including:
  - Direct connections
  - Reverse proxy headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP)
  - LiveView socket assigns
  - Fallback to "unknown" when IP cannot be determined

  ## One resolution rule for both paths

  The conn path is resolved by the endpoint's `RemoteIp` plug: the entries of
  `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` are read in the order the headers arrived,
  and the rightmost one that is not a proxy hop names the visitor. The socket
  path (`get_from_mount/1`) applies the same rule to the same two headers, so
  neither header outranks the other. Giving `X-Real-IP` precedence on the
  socket alone let one visitor resolve to two addresses, and therefore two
  rate-limit buckets, depending on whether a request arrived over HTTP or the
  LiveView socket.

  Because the rightmost entry across both headers wins, a proxy that sets
  only `X-Real-IP` but passes a client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` through
  unchanged lets the client choose its own address whenever that header
  arrives after `X-Real-IP`. Operators must have the proxy strip or
  overwrite `X-Forwarded-For` (nginx: `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For
  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;` appends the real peer, which is then the
  rightmost entry). The same holds for the conn path, which `RemoteIp`
  resolves the same way.
