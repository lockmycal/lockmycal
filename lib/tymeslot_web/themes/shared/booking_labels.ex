  Labels shared by every theme's booking form.

  Both themes ask the same two questions of the same data (what does the submit
  button say, and what do we call the organiser), and answered them with
  byte-identical private copies that differed only in the label used when the
  meeting type is ungated. Approval added a third and fourth branch to that
  `cond`, which is exactly the point at which two copies start to drift: a
  wording fix applied to one theme silently leaves the other behind.

  The submit button's label.

  A gated meeting type submits a request rather than a booking, and says so, so
  that nobody presses a button reading "Book meeting" and receives a held
  request instead. `ungated_label` is the theme's own wording for the ordinary
  case ("Book meeting", "Submit"), passed in already translated so each theme
  keeps its own literal at its own call site for extraction.
