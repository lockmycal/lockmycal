defmodule TymeslotWeb.Themes.Shared.ReschedulePin do
  @moduledoc """
  Pins a reschedule to the meeting type of the booking it is moving.

  A reschedule is not a choice of meeting type. `Tymeslot.Bookings.Reschedule`
  re-reads the type from the meeting on submit, so whichever card the booker
  clicks is discarded either way. Left as a list of every type the organiser
  offers, the overview step asks a question whose answer cannot be used: the
  booker picks "In person", the booking moves as the video meeting it has
  always been, and nothing says so.

  Pinned, the step shows one card — the meeting's own — already selected, so it
  confirms what is being moved and "next" is a single click. It also keeps a
  guest who only wants a different time from being shown the host's entire
  catalogue on the way.

  The pin is the *only* meeting-type resolver a reschedule uses. `LiveHelpers`
  applies it on every `handle_params`, and the schedule and booking entries
  defer to it rather than resolving the slug in the URL. That is what a stale
  or hand-edited link like `/:username/<another-slug>?reschedule_meeting_uid=…`
  turns on: resolved by slug, the page offers slots against one type's schedule
  while the submit validates against the meeting's own.

  A type the host has deleted since the booking resolves to `nil`, and then the
  choice is a real one: the page falls back to the full list, as before.

  Leaves the reschedule behind: the page is booking afresh again.

  "Schedule Another Meeting" restarts the flow in place, without navigating, so
  `handle_params/3` never runs a second time and nothing else drops the
  reschedule context. Left on the socket, `:reschedule_meeting_uid` is what the
  next submit still dispatches on, and the booker moves the meeting they have
  just moved rather than getting the new one they asked for.

  Clearing `:is_rescheduling` is not enough on its own: the uid is what the
  orchestrator receives, and the pin has replaced `:meeting_types` with the one
  type being moved. The organiser's catalogue is re-resolved the way the mount
  resolves it, which is also what keeps a demo organiser whole: its types are
  synthesised by the overlay rather than stored, so no query could rebuild them.
