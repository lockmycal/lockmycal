defmodule TymeslotWeb.Themes.Shared.BookingLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Socket-state orchestration for the booking form's location picker.

  A meeting type offering one location has nothing to ask, so the picker is
  not rendered and the single option is simply the answer. Two or more and
  the booker chooses; a phone option can additionally ask them for their own
  number, a video option listing several providers asks which one, and an
  in-person option listing several saved venues asks which venue. A single
  video location with several providers, or a single in-person location with
  several venues, is itself a choice, so the picker shows for it too.

  A single in-person location with at most one venue asks nothing, but the
  booking step still states it (`stated_location?/1`): its venue's name and
  address, or the note that the address is arranged after booking
  (`arranged_after_booking?/1`).

  The committed choice lives in `:selected_location_id` (and, for a video
  option, `:selected_video_id`; for an in-person option, `:selected_venue_id`),
  and the booking submission reads it from there. Only those ids cross the
  wire: everything the choice means (the location string, its kind, which
  video integration the room is created on, which venue it is at) is derived
  server-side from the host's own stored option by
  `Tymeslot.MeetingTypes.resolve_location/2`, so a forged id resolves to a
  location the host already offers rather than one the booker invented.

  The client-side check here is for fast feedback only. `resolve_location/2`
  re-derives everything from the meeting type on submission regardless of
  what these assigns say.

  ## On a reschedule

  The picker opens on the location, and the venue, the meeting already has,
  not the host's first, and the booker can move it. A meeting type with a
  single location still asks nothing, and then no choice is submitted at all
  (`submitted_option_id/1`): with nothing shown, nothing the booker did can
  have meant "move it", even when the host has since replaced the location
  the meeting was booked against.

  The venue follows the same rule within the meeting's own location
  (`:reschedule_location`). When the meeting's venue is no longer offered
  (deleted, or dropped from its location), or it was booked without one,
  the picker opens with no venue chosen and nothing is submitted until the
  booker picks one (`:venue_picked`): a time-only reschedule keeps the
  meeting at the address it was booked for. Until then the page states that
  kept location, as the meeting stores it (`kept_location/1`), rather than
  whatever the location now offers, so it never promises an address the
  reschedule will not write. Choosing another location is itself a move, so
  there the venue the picker shows is submitted.

  Loads the meeting type's locations and preselects one.

  The first option is preselected rather than leaving the choice blank: the
  booker can always change it, and a form that cannot be submitted until an
  invisible default is filled in is a worse first impression than one that
  opens on the host's preferred location. The same goes for the provider of
  a video option and the venue of an in-person one.

  A selection the booker has already made survives a re-entry into the step,
  which is what makes going back to the calendar and returning non-destructive.

  `current`, on a reschedule, is the meeting's own choice
  (`%{option_id: …, phone: …, video_integration_id: …, venue_id: …}`), which
  opens the picker there instead of on the first option. A choice the meeting
  type no longer offers falls back to the first option like any other.
