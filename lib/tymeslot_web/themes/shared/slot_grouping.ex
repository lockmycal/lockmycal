  Decides how a day's slots are presented, and groups them accordingly.

  A meeting type may offer starts on a grid finer than its own duration, which
  turns a working day into around a hundred slots. Both themes already group
  slots into parts of the day; at that density the grouping stops helping, so
  the slots are nested one level deeper, under the hour they fall in, and the
  booker opens one hour at a time.

  The decision is made here rather than in either theme so the two cannot
  disagree, and so a theme renders whichever shape it is handed without
  knowing why.

  # duration-locked 30-minute meeting already shows flat, so the accordion
  # would hide a list no longer than the one it replaced; at 60 it holds one,
  # and opening an hour reveals a single time whose label repeats the button
  # that was just clicked. Both are strictly worse than the flat grid.
  #
  # A fixed interval bound rather than a slot count, because the count varies
  # with how booked up a day is: the same page would then render differently

  Whether the two-tier hour picker applies.

  Two conditions, both necessary. The grid must be finer than the meeting
  itself, since an interval longer than the duration produces *fewer* slots
  than the default and belongs on the flat grid. And an hour must hold at
  least three starts (`interval <= #{@max_two_tier_interval}`), or grouping by
  hour compresses nothing and only adds a click.
