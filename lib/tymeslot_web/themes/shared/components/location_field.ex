defmodule TymeslotWeb.Themes.Shared.Components.LocationField do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared "where shall we meet?" picker for scheduling themes.

  Renders the meeting type's locations as a horizontal row of toggles, each
  with its kind's icon, and beneath it the chosen option's detail. Only the
  chosen option's detail is shown: a row of toggles has no room for an
  address on every one. Follow-up questions appear under the row when the
  chosen location asks them: which video provider, as a second row of
  toggles, when a video location offers several; which venue, as a list with
  each venue's address beneath its name, when an in-person location offers
  several; and a number input when a phone location asks the booker for
  theirs.

  An in-person location's detail is its one venue's name and address, or,
  with no venue, the note that the address is arranged after booking
  (`arranged_note/1`). A reschedule that keeps the meeting where it is
  (`kept_location`) states the meeting's own location instead: its address,
  or the note when its address is still to be arranged. `stated_location/1` renders the same for a meeting
  type whose single in-person location asks nothing, so the booker still
  learns where the meeting is.

  The location row itself is left out when there is only one location, as
  happens for a single video location offering several providers: the
  provider row is then the whole question.

  All state lives in the parent LiveView (`location_options`,
  `selected_location_id`, `video_choices`, `selected_video_id`,
  `venue_choices`, `selected_venue_id`, `location_phone`, `location_error`);
  this component is purely presentational and forwards its events to the
  booking-step component via `phx-target`, which relays them to the
  LiveView.

  A venue's description may run over several lines, which themes keep with
  `white-space: pre-line`. It is therefore rendered flush against its
  `<span>` tags: any whitespace the template put around it would survive as
  a blank line above and below the address.

  Each toggle carries more than a row of toggles shows (an icon tile, a
  one-line hint under the title, a check mark), so a theme can lay the
  options out as cards instead; a theme keeping the compact row hides those
  parts.

  The markup is theme-agnostic and ships no styling of its own. Each theme
  styles the `location-*` classes in its own `booking-form.css`, scoped to
  its wrapper, exactly as it does for `guest-*`.

  Each toggle wraps a visually hidden native radio rather than being a
  button, because this is a single choice from a short list and the browser
  already gives that arrow-key navigation and a group role for free. They
  sit outside the booking `<form>` and post nothing: the choice is pushed as
  an event and read from socket state.
