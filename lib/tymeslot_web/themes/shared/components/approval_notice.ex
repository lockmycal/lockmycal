defmodule TymeslotWeb.Themes.Shared.Components.ApprovalNotice do
  @moduledoc """
  Tells a booking visitor that this meeting type needs the host's approval.

  Two variants of one fact, sized for where they appear:

    * `pill/1` — a small marker beside a meeting type in the overview list.
      Answers "is there a catch?" at a glance.
    * `block/1` — a fuller sentence on the booking form, the post-payment
      wait screen, and the thank-you screen, where the visitor is deciding
      or has just committed and deserves the whole rule rather than a hint
      of it.

  ## Why this exists at all

  A visitor who picks a time expects to have booked it. On a gated meeting
  type they have not, and the moment they find that out should be *before*
  they submit, not in an email afterwards. Four call sites carry the
  notice, escalating in detail as the commitment grows: the overview
  (`pill/1`, beside the gated type), the booking form (`block/1`,
  `stage: :before`), the post-checkout wait screen for a paid gated type
  (`block/1`, `stage: :after`), and the confirmation screen (`block/1`,
  `stage: :after`). The schedule and questions steps in between carry none
  — the visitor has already seen the pill by then, and repeating the
  notice on every intermediate step would be noise rather than disclosure.

  Follows the shared-component pattern of `MeetingDetails`: neutral class
  names here, visual treatment in each theme's own CSS, because the themes are
  self-contained and share no tokens.

  Callers pass `requires_approval` through `Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval.required?/1`
  rather than reading the field, because SaaS demo organisers supply meeting
  types as plain maps that have no such key.

  The fuller notice, for the booking form and the thank-you screen.

  `stage` decides the tense: `:before` warns what will happen, `:after`
  describes what just did. `payment_required` only changes the `:before`
  text, for a meeting type that is both paid and gated: the visitor is
  told they are charged now, ahead of the host's decision, and refunded
  in full if the request is declined or lapses.
