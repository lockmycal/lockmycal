  Handles booking submission from the LiveView.
  This centralizes the validation and submission logic by delegating to
  the shared BookingSubmissionHandlerComponent.

  When the meeting type requires payment, the handler returns a socket that
  is already configured to redirect to the Stripe Checkout URL — we forward
  that socket without transitioning to the confirmation step so the
  attendee leaves the booking flow for the hosted payment page.

  When the booker is embedded inside an iframe (Stripe Checkout cannot
  render in an iframe), the handler instead instructs the browser to open
  Checkout in a new tab and we transition to the local `:awaiting_payment`
  view; the LiveView subscribes to `meeting_payment:<id>` and flips back
  to `:confirmation` on `:paid` or `:booking` on `:expired`.
