  Behaviour for theme implementations to ensure complete independence.

  Each theme can define its own flow, components, and UI patterns while
  maintaining a consistent interface for the main scheduling system.

  Returns the state machine definition for this theme.
  Each theme can have its own flow (2-step, 4-step, etc.)

  Declarative only: the *runtime* flow comes from the shared
  `Shared.StateMachineHelpers.states_for/1`, not from this callback. No
  production code calls `states/0` today — `Loader` still enforces it via
  `function_exported?/3`, and `ThemeCommonTestCases` exercises it directly, so
  it stays part of the contract as a documented, tested declaration of each
  theme's step shape.
