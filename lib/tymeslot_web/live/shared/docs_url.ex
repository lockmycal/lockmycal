  @moduledoc """
  Builds links into the docs hub.

  The docs hub is a hosted site that standalone Core does not serve, so the
  default points there; an operator running their own docs sets
  `:docs_article_base_url` and every link in the dashboard and the
  feature-announcement modal (`Tymeslot.Announcements.docs_url/1`) follows.
  This is the single place that key is read and normalised.
