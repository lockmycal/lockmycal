defmodule TymeslotWeb.MeetingRequestLive do
  @moduledoc """
  Where a host answers a booking request from the link in their email.

  Reachable without a session, because the point is to answer from a phone in
  the ten seconds after reading the mail. Authorisation is the signed token
  (`Tymeslot.Meetings.ApprovalToken`), which names both the meeting and the
  organiser it was issued for; a token whose organiser no longer matches the
  meeting is refused.

  ## Nothing happens on load

  The `intent` query parameter preselects Approve or Decline but never acts.
  Mail security products and link-preview crawlers fetch every URL in an
  inbound message, so a page that approved as a side effect of being loaded
  would fill hosts' calendars with meetings they never saw. The decision is a
  `phx-click`, which arrives over the LiveView socket and no crawler sends.

  Answering twice is safe: `Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval` resolves the race in
  the database, and the loser is shown what actually happened rather than an
  error.
