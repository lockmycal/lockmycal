defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.PaymentsSettings.StatusCard do
  @moduledoc """
  Stripe Connect onboarding status banner.

  Stateless function component rendered by `PaymentsSettingsComponent`. Maps a
  connect account's display state — derived once by
  `Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.connect_display_state/1` — to a variant, title, and
  message.

  Two states are distinct on purpose:

    * `:incomplete` — the host started connecting but has not finished Stripe
      onboarding (`details_submitted: false`). There is nothing for Stripe to
      review yet, so the banner shows a "Finish connecting Stripe" prompt with
      a Continue-onboarding button that re-POSTs to `/dashboard/payments/connect`
      for a fresh Stripe AccountLink.
    * `:pending_review` — onboarding *is* submitted but charges/payouts are not
      yet enabled, i.e. Stripe is genuinely reviewing the account.
    * `:restricted` — Stripe disabled the account after reviewing it
      (`disabled_reason` set). The banner links out to the host's own Stripe
      dashboard (`MeetingPayments.stripe_dashboard_url/0`) to resolve it,
      since a Standard account's owner has full Stripe Dashboard access
      themselves — mirrors the link already sent in the restriction email
      (`Tymeslot.Emails.Templates.ConnectAccountRestricted`).

  `needs_onboarding?/1` is exposed so the parent can hide the operational
  sections (currency, payments, stats, disconnect) until onboarding is
  submitted, off the same single source of truth as the banner.
