defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.PaymentsSettings.DisconnectModal do
  @moduledoc """
  Confirmation modal for disconnecting the host's Stripe account.

  Stateless function component rendered by `PaymentsSettingsComponent`. The
  Cancel/Disconnect actions dispatch `close_disconnect_modal` and `disconnect`
  events back to the parent component (`@myself`), which owns the modal's
  open/closed state and performs the disconnect.

  Two consequences are named before the host confirms, because both are
  invisible afterwards. `@pending_count` is what the disconnect will cancel;
  `@outstanding_refunds` is what it will not touch and can no longer settle,
  money the host is already holding on the attendee's behalf and will have to
  refund from their Stripe dashboard instead.
