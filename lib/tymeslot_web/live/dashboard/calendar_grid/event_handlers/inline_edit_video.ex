  The video-provider picker on a calendar-grid event's detail panel.

  Its own handler rather than one more field in
  `TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.CalendarGrid.EventHandlers.InlineEdit`: choosing a
  provider is not a text edit but a room being created on someone else's
  server, and it carries guards the other inline edits have no use for: the
  video integration must be the organiser's, and the event must not be the
  calendar copy of a booking, whose room belongs to the meeting.

  Applies the organiser's video choice as an edit in its own right.

  Picking a provider provisions a room and puts its link on the event;
  picking "None" takes the link off. Both go through the same guards, rate
  limit and optimistic update as every other inline edit, and both answer the
  organiser once the provider and the calendar have replied.
