  @moduledoc """
  Answering a booking request from the dashboard.

  The transition itself belongs to `Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval`, which is also
  what the emailed link calls; this module is only the dashboard's half of it.
  Two things live here rather than in the component:

    * **The ownership check.** The lookup is scoped to the signed-in host, so
      an id belonging to somebody else is not found rather than answered.

    * **Losing the race gracefully.** The host may have already answered in
      another tab, from the email, or the expiry sweep may have released the
      slot. None of those is an error to show as one, so the loser is told what
      actually happened and the list is reloaded.

  `reload` is passed in rather than imported so this module stays free of the
  component's loading pipeline; it is called after every outcome, including the
  failures, because the row on screen is stale either way.

  Starts one approval action against a held request off the socket's process.

  `opts` carries the `:success` and `:failure` flash messages and the `:reload`
  function to refresh the list with. The transition itself, and its
  calendar/video/notification fan-out, runs inside `start_async/3` so
  `:answering_request` stays set across a render and the row's spinner and
  disabled state actually paint; `handle_answer/3` reports the outcome once
  the task completes.

  action's return value (`{:ok, action_result}` on completion, `{:exit,
  reason}` if the task itself crashed).

  The row on screen is reloaded on every outcome, including the failures and
  the crash, because it is stale either way — matching `answer/4`'s
  synchronous not-found/already-answered path.
