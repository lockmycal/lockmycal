  Adding guests to a booking that already exists.

  The host's own path, which is why the meeting type's `allow_guests` is not
  consulted: that setting governs the public booking form. `Bookings.CreateAdHoc`
  makes the same distinction when a host books on someone's behalf.

  Ownership, the meeting's state and the cap are all enforced again by
  `Guests.invite_for_organizer/3` when the host confirms; the checks here only
  decide what the dialog offers. Mail is left to `Meetings.Guests` and the
  email job: every guest carries its
  own `confirmation_sent_at`, so a guest added now is invited and the guests
  already there are not written to again.

  Puts an address on the list the dialog is building, without inviting anyone

  Addresses are collected one at a time, as they are everywhere else in the

  because a host copying a line out of an email should not have to take it
  apart by hand.

  An address that is not valid, the booker's own, one already on the meeting
  or already staged, and any past the meeting's remaining room are refused,
  and a flash says why, as Quick Add does, rather than leaving the host to
  wonder where the address went. Validity is `Guests.valid_email?/1`, the rule
  `Guests.invite_for_organizer/3` applies, so an address staged here is never
  dropped on confirm.
