defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.PaymentsSettingsComponent do
  @moduledoc """
  Host-facing payments dashboard, rendered inside the dashboard shell.

  Surfaces the Stripe Connect onboarding state, recent payments, lifetime
  totals, the default-currency selector, the refund flow, and the disconnect
  flow. The whole section is gated behind the `:meeting_payments` feature
  (the gate itself lives in `DashboardLive.handle_params/3`).

  This component owns only orchestration: data loading, event handling, and
  composing the presentational sub-components under
  `TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.PaymentsSettings.*`. Following the dashboard
  convention, it reloads the host's payments, stats, and pending count in
  `update/2` — the connect account is reused from the integrations hub's
  already-loaded `connect_account` assign when present, and loaded
  independently only when mounted standalone (the `:payments` dashboard
  action). Flash messages are forwarded to the parent LiveView via `Flash`
  (a bare `put_flash/3` inside a LiveComponent never reaches the rendered
  flash group).

        the host has already incurred, and they do not stop existing when the
