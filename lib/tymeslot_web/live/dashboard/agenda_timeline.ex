defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.AgendaTimeline do
  @moduledoc """
  Turns a day's timed entries into an ordered *spine* for the dashboard agenda —
  the vertical time-rail that replaces the old flat list.

  A spine is a list of rows the component renders top to bottom:

    * `{:event, entry, meta}` — an appointment block. `meta` carries
      `next?` (the hero the cockpit zooms into) and `in_progress?` (started but
      not yet ended).
    * `{:gap, minutes}` — a labelled free stretch between two consecutive
      appointments. Dead time is compressed to a connector and *named* rather
      than drawn to scale, so a short meeting never vanishes and an empty morning
      never dominates the rail.
    * `:now` — the live now-line, placed once at its true position in the
      sequence: after anything in progress, before the next thing to start.

  This module is pure: entries in, rows out. All time reasoning is anchored to a
  `now` passed by the caller, so it is trivially testable and never reads the
  clock itself.
