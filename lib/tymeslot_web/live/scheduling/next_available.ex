defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.NextAvailable do
  @moduledoc """
  Lands the booker on the first bookable day instead of an empty grid.

  Entering the schedule step used to assign nothing but the current
  month: `selected_date` stayed `nil`, so the booker faced a month of
  greyed-out squares and had to hunt for a live one before a single time
  appeared. Where the host was fully booked for the rest of the month
  that hunt failed silently — the grid renders an all-disabled month
  exactly the same way it renders a month nobody has looked at yet, and
  nothing on screen suggests pressing "next month" would help.

  So the selection is made from the availability map the schedule step
  already fetches. `month_availability_map` is `%{"2026-01-15" => bool}`
  over the 42-day display range, which is the same data the grid paints
  from, so the day picked here is always a day the booker can see and
  click. No extra query buys the common case.

  Two boundaries decide the rest:

    * The map spans a *display* range, not a calendar month, so it
      carries days belonging to the neighbouring months. Selecting one
      without moving the visible window would highlight a day drawn as
      an adjacent-month square, or none at all — `align_to/2` moves the
      month and the week to wherever the chosen day actually lives.

    * When the whole range is dead the search steps forward a month at a
      time, bounded by the resolved booking window. That bound is the same
      one `CalendarNavigation.next_month_disabled?/4` uses to grey out the
      forward arrow, so this never lands on a month the booker could not
      have reached by hand.

  A date carried in on the URL — a shared link, a link back into a half-made
  booking — is a deliberate choice and is left untouched; `apply/1` only fills
  a blank selection.

  A reschedule gets the same landing as any other booking. It is the case that
  needs it most: a slot is being moved because the host's calendar was busy
  enough to require it, so the rescheduler faces the emptiest grid of anyone.

  The landing is attempted once per arrival at the step, and every terminal
  outcome spends the attempt — including the ones that select nothing. Leaving
  it armed is what turns a later refetch into a calendar that walks backwards;
  `settle/1` documents that failure in full.

  Selects the first available day and loads its slots.

  Returns `{socket, :done}` when the work is finished — a day was
  selected, the selection was left alone, or the search hit its bound —
  and `{socket, :refetch}` when the window has been moved forward and the
  caller must fetch availability for the new month.

  The refetch is handed back rather than performed here so this module
  keeps no dependency on the fetcher that calls it: `AvailabilityHelpers`
  already reaches `NextAvailable` through `InfoHandlers`, and calling
  back into it from here would close that loop into a cycle.

  Spends the landing attempt without selecting anything.

  Callers use this for the outcomes that never reach `apply/1`: a fetch that
  errored produces no map to search, but it was still the one chance to land,
  and treating it as a deferral is what leaves the calendar moving under the
  booker later.

  Every navigation control clears or bypasses `selected_date` and refetches —
  Quill's month arrows blank it outright, Rhythm's week arrows cross a month
  boundary, and a calendar-sync broadcast refetches with no input at all. Any
  of those, with the attempt still unspent, re-enters `apply/1` against the new
  month's map. That map spans a *display* range whose leading row belongs to
  the month just left, so the earliest free day in it is routinely a day
  behind the booker, and `align_to/2` then drags the visible window back onto
  it: press "next", travel backwards.

  A no-op before the schedule step, so a fetch that fails on the overview
  leaves the landing intact for the step that has not been reached yet.

  Re-arms the landing for a fresh entry into the schedule step.

  The attempt is spent per *entry*, not per LiveView. `do_handle_schedule_entry/2`
  resets the calendar to today's month every time the booker arrives, so a
  second arrival — back to the overview, a different duration, forward again —
  is a new landing and gets its own hop budget. Without the reset a search that
  spent its budget on a booked-out duration would silently disable itself for
  every duration chosen afterwards.
