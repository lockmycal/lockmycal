defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.PreviewToken do
  @moduledoc """
  Signs and verifies owner booking-page preview tokens.

  The owner-preview flow renders a user's *own* published booking page in an
  iframe and SIMULATES submissions — no real meeting, confirmation email, or
  calendar event. Because the booking page is public and unauthenticated, the
  simulate gate must not be a guessable query param (`?preview=true` alone is
  trivially forgeable). It is a short-lived token, signed with the server
  secret and bound to the page owner's user id, minted only inside the owner's
  authenticated session.

  Two properties follow:

    * A visitor cannot forge a token, so a bare `?preview=true` never reaches
      simulate mode. It does not book for real either: an unbacked preview
      claim is failed closed by `BookingSubmissionHandlerComponent`, so that a
      token expiring mid-session cannot turn the owner's test booking into a
      real meeting they never see.
    * A leaked token only ever simulates the *owner's own* page. `owner?/2`
      requires the bound id to match the page being viewed, so it cannot be
      replayed against a third party to silently swallow their bookings.

  `?preview=` and `?theme=` are display parameters, not authorisation, and
  `PreviewMode` is the single place that says so.
