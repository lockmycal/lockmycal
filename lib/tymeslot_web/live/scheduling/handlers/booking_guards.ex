  The abuse gates a public booking submission must clear before it reaches the
  booking domain.

  Booking is unauthenticated and creates records, sends mail and can take
  payment, so it is the most attractive endpoint in the product to abuse. Four
  independent defences guard it, each covering a gap the others leave:

    * **Honeypot** — a hidden `website` field no human fills in. Checked before
      anything else because it is free, and answered with a *fake success* so a
      bot cannot tell a tripped honeypot from a real booking and adapt.
    * **Duplicate lock** — a per-session flag stopping a double-clicked form
      from creating two meetings.
    * **Per-IP rate limit** — the general flood defence.
    * **reCAPTCHA or Cloudflare Turnstile** — scripted submissions that pace
      themselves under the IP limit (whichever provider the admin has
      configured for booking, see
      `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.Security.BotProtection`).
    * **Per-recipient rate limit** — keyed on the attendee's email, this is the
      one that survives an attacker rotating source IPs to bomb a single
      mailbox with confirmation mail. It runs on the *validated* address, so it
      must come after form validation.

  Both rate limits are skipped for a verified owner preview, which creates
  nothing to be limited; see `preview_submission?/1` for why the weaker
  `:theme_preview` claim does not qualify.

  ## Why they are composed here

  `run/3` applies them in one place and in a fixed order. Spread across a
  caller's `with` chain, a new submission path is one forgotten clause away
  from being unprotected, and the ordering constraints above are invisible.

  Every failure exits through `release_submission/1`. The duplicate lock is
  claimed before the later gates run, so a branch that clears only
  `:submitting` leaves `:submission_processed` set and wedges the form: every
  retry in that session is refused as "already being processed" until the
  booker reloads the page.
