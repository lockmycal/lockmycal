defmodule TymeslotWeb.AuthLive.VerificationEvents do
  @moduledoc """
  Resending the verification email, lifted out of `TymeslotWeb.AuthLive`.

  ## The cooldown starts on every click

  The countdown is started before anything else happens, and regardless of how
  the resend turns out. Only starting it on success would leave the button live
  while a rate-limited or errored request is in flight, which is exactly when it
  gets clicked again. Server-side rate limiting remains the real boundary; this
  is the UX guard in front of it.

  A click arriving while the countdown is still running is dropped rather than
  restarting it: the button is disabled client-side, but a fast double-click can
  deliver a second event before the DOM patch lands, and handling it would spawn
  a second timer chain that drains the countdown at twice the rate.

  ## Only a session-bound account is ever sent anything

  The resend goes to the unverified user bound to this session (proved by
  password at login, or created by this process at sign-up), never to an
  address typed into a form. Every outcome, sent, unknown, already verified or
  over the account's own allowance, reads "Verification email sent!", so the
  button cannot be used to learn whether an address has an account.

  ## With nothing bound, the answer depends only on the session

  A reload or a direct visit binds no account and follows no sign-up. The
  resend then sends the visitor to sign in, which binds their account again
  once the password is proved. A sign-up answered in this process (see below)
  keeps the "sent" reply instead, since it has to match a genuine one.

  ## Honeypot and duplicate signups have nothing to resend

  A signup caught by the honeypot, or one for an address that already had an
  account, bound no user, so there is no email to send. It still has to *look*
  identical, down to the rate limiting, or the difference in behaviour is
  itself the tell.
