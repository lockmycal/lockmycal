defmodule TymeslotWeb.Components.Dashboard.Meetings.RemindersSection do
  @moduledoc """
  The reminders a booking carries, as shown on its card in the meetings list.

  Read-only: a booking's reminders are fixed when it is made, and this says
  what they are and how far they have got. It is the only place a host can see
  them after the fact — the meeting type shows its *current* setting, which a
  booking made before a change no longer follows, and a quick-added meeting has
  no meeting type at all.

  A stateful component only so that `update_many/1` can batch: whether a
  reminder is "not yet sent" depends on a job existing for it, and every card
  on the page is answered by one query rather than one each.
  `reminders_section/1` is the entry point, so callers render it like any other
  function component.
