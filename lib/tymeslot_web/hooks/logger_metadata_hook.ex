  @moduledoc """
  LiveView hook that sets Logger process metadata for correlation and user tracking.

  LiveView processes are separate Erlang processes that don't inherit Logger metadata
  from the HTTP request that initiated them. This hook ensures every LiveView process
  has a `correlation_id` (generated fresh per mount) and, when available, a `user_id`
  in its Logger metadata — matching the context that Plug-based requests get via
  `CorrelationId` and `SetLoggerMetadata`.
