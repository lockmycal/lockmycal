  @moduledoc """
  LiveView hook that sets Logger metadata and error context for correlation and
  user tracking.

  LiveView processes are separate Erlang processes that don't inherit Logger metadata
  from the HTTP request that initiated them. This hook ensures every LiveView process
  has a `correlation_id` (generated fresh per mount) and, when available, a `user_id`,
  in its Logger metadata and in the context ErrorTracker stores with any exception
  the LiveView raises, matching the context that Plug-based requests get via
  `CorrelationId` and `SetLoggerMetadata`.
