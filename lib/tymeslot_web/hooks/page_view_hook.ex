defmodule TymeslotWeb.Hooks.PageViewHook do
  @moduledoc """
  LiveView `on_mount` hook that logs a `booking_page_view` event when
  a connected socket mounts on a public scheduling page.

  No work is scheduled unless booking analytics is enabled
  (`Tymeslot.Analytics.enabled?/0`); when disabled the hook is a no-op
  beyond assigning the session referrer.

  The hook only fires on `connected?(socket)` — the initial static
  HTML render is skipped, which automatically filters out the bulk
  of crawlers that never establish a WebSocket. Remaining bot user
  agents are filtered by `Tymeslot.Analytics.log_page_view/1`, which
  also applies per-visitor rate limiting before persisting.

  The actual write happens inside a supervised Task to avoid adding
  latency to the LiveView mount path. Any failure inside the Task
  is swallowed — analytics must never break the booking flow;
  `Tymeslot.Analytics.log_page_view/1` emits the outcome as telemetry
  so a drop is still observable.

  `:async_page_view_logging` selects the write mode. It defaults to
  `true`; setting it `false` runs the write inline on the mount path
  instead, which trades a little mount latency for a write that
  completes within the caller's lifetime. The test environment sets
  it `false` so the write is owned by the test process and cannot
  outlive it — a fire-and-forget Task racing sandbox teardown dies
  with a `DBConnection.OwnershipError` that ExUnit does not fail on.
  It is read via `Application.compile_env/3` rather than `Mix.env()`,
  which lies when Core is built as a path dependency.

  Only cheap, in-memory data (user agent, IP, socket ID, params,
  session referrer) is captured before spawning the Task. The signed-in
  viewer's id arrives in the session as `"viewer_user_id"`, resolved by the
  router from the request's current user, so an organiser's visit to their
  own booking page can be skipped without a lookup here. The
  database lookups for user and meeting-type context run inside the
  Task, off the mount path.
