defmodule TymeslotWeb.Gettext.Pseudo do
  @moduledoc """
  Pseudo-localisation transform for the `"pseudo"` development locale.

  Pseudo-localisation is a coverage-testing technique, not a real language.
  Every string that genuinely flows through Gettext is rewritten into an
  accented, bracketed, padded look-alike:

      "Save changes"  ->  "⟦Šávé çħáñgéš····⟧"

  This surfaces two classes of bug at a glance:

  1. **Un-wrapped strings.** Any user-facing text that is *not* bracketed on a
     pseudo-locale page never went through Gettext — it is a hard-coded literal
     that would ship untranslated. The `⟦` marker is what the automated
     coverage crawl keys on.

  2. **Truncation / overflow.** The accented characters plus the ~30 %
     `·`-padding widen every label, exposing fixed-width buttons, clipped
     table cells, and layouts that only ever saw English.

  The transform is applied to the resolved English string, with its bindings
  already interpolated (see `TymeslotWeb.Gettext`), so it pseudo-ises exactly
  the text a user would see.

  Activation is gated behind `Tymeslot.Locales.pseudo_enabled?/0`, which is
  `false` everywhere except dev. It can never render in production.
