  Handles meeting creation event.

  Raised at most once per meeting. A booking with a video room defers this
  event to `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoomWorker` so the payload can carry the join
  link, and that job announces the booking without one if the room is taking
  too long — a room that then arrives on a later attempt would otherwise fan
  the event out a second time, to every email, webhook, Telegram chat and Slack
  channel subscribed to it.

  The claim is taken before the fan-out rather than after it, so two callers
  racing cannot both dispatch. A fan-out that then fails keeps the claim: every
  channel here is best-effort and none of the callers retry the event, so
  releasing it would buy nothing and would risk announcing twice instead.

  A booking can win the claim a second time in one case: a reschedule sent it
  back into the approval gate, which frees the claim so the host's approval of
  the new time still gets the invitee their emails and reminders. To the
  integration channels that booking is not new, so webhooks, Telegram and
  Slack receive `meeting.rescheduled` for it instead, and `meeting.created`
  fires once per meeting across its whole life. The emails are the same either
  way: the confirmation is suppressed by its sent flags, and
  `Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval` sends the reschedule notice itself.
