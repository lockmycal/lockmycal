defmodule Tymeslot.Precommit.Runner do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared engine behind `mix precommit` and `mix saas.precommit`.

  Runs a list of `{name, args, env}` steps, keeps going after a failure so a
  single run reports everything that needs fixing, and prints a summary. The
  one exception is compilation: any step named "compile" (or a variant, such
  as a second compile in a different `MIX_ENV`) is a barrier: if it fails,
  downstream steps would only report noise, so the run stops there.

  ## What runs at the same time

  Once the compile barriers have passed, nothing downstream needs anything from
  another step beyond the build they established, so run in sequence the gate
  simply adds every step's wall clock together. Instead:

    * **The suite** starts in the background straight away. It is the long pole
      and the only step under `MIX_ENV=test`, so it takes a different build lock
      from everything else and never waits on it. Given a `:suite_plan`, it is
      also split into `mix test --partitions` runs of its own (see
      *Partitioning the suite*).
    * **Steps that write the dev build** (`gettext.check`, which recompiles when
      its inputs moved) run next, one at a time in the foreground, so nothing
      reads the build while it is being rewritten.
    * **Every other step** then runs concurrently. They only read the build, or
      reach it through `mix compile`, which Mix serialises behind its build lock
      and which is a no-op by this point. Each of these is mostly Mix boot time
      plus one tool, so the group finishes in about the time of its slowest
      member, credo or dialyzer, instead of their sum.

  Output from a concurrent step is buffered and printed whole when that step
  finishes, so two steps never interleave; the suite's arrives in one block at
  the end. That is the cost of the arrangement: nothing scrolls live after the
  compile steps.

  ## Step results as they happen

  Every step also prints one plain line the moment it finishes, before any
  buffered output that goes with it: `precommit: ok credo`, or `precommit:
  failed test (2)`. The suite's comes from its own task, so it is not held back
  until the static checks are done. The prefix is a contract: the workspace
  `mix.sh -p` buffers each repository's output until the whole run finishes, and
  forwards only these lines to the terminal as they arrive, so a run that is
  interrupted has still reported every step that finished.

  `--fail-fast` turns all of this off and runs everything in sequence. It asks
  for the first failure as soon as possible, which is incompatible with steps
  whose results are only known when they finish together.

  ## Steps left out on purpose

  `mix precommit --affected` drops the steps a diff cannot reach (see
  `Tymeslot.Precommit.Affected`) and passes them as `:skipped`, each with its
  reason. The summary lists them after the steps that ran, so a narrowed run
  can never read as the full gate.

  ## Partitioning the suite

  Most of the suite's wall clock is its synchronous modules, which ExUnit runs
  one at a time however many cores are free. Partitions are separate OS
  processes, so they run those modules side by side. The `:suite_plan` option
  is called when the suite starts and returns how many partitions to run and how
  many schedulers each may use (see `Tymeslot.Precommit.CpuBudget`), or `nil` to
  run it whole.

  Each partition gets its own database and upload directory through
  `MIX_TEST_PARTITION`, which `mix test --partitions` requires to be the bare
  partition number. A worktree already uses that variable as its database
  suffix, so the incoming value is passed on as `MIX_TEST_PARTITION_BASE` and
  the test config joins the two: partition 3 in a worktree suffixed `_next`
  uses `tymeslot_test_next3`. The databases are created and migrated by the
  `test` alias on first use.

  A partitioned run therefore never touches the unnumbered test database, which
  is what lets another repository's suite use that one at the same time.

  # It was pinned to 4 as a memory guard, on a 13G figure measured while
  # building a PLT from scratch. This step does that on the days a dependency or
  # the toolchain moves and on no others; the warm run it performs the rest of
  # the time holds 4.2G to 5.4G whether it is handed 4 schedulers or 16. So the
  # number is a speed setting, and the memory guard is the systemd scope in the
  # workspace `mix.sh`, which bounds the whole process tree however much
  # dialyzer asks for. Measured on Core on a 16-core host, three runs each,
  # median wall clock: 92s at 4, 77s at 8, 92s at 16, the last losing to
  # coordination overhead. The cap is never more than the cores the run may use
  # (`System.schedulers_online/0`, which honours a CPU quota), so a smaller
  # machine is not handed more schedulers than it has.
  #
  # The cap is keyed off the command rather than the step's display name, and set
  # here rather than for the run as a whole, so the test suite in the same
  # `mix precommit` keeps every core. `MIX_DIALYZER_SCHEDULERS` overrides it,
  # matching the flag of the same name in the workspace `mix.sh`.
  #
  # Both task names are matched. The gate runs `dialyzer.incremental`, while
