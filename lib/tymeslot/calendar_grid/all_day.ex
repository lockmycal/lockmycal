defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.AllDay do
  @moduledoc """
  Converting a calendar event between all-day and timed.

  The two representations do not overlap: an all-day event carries
  `start_date`/`end_date` and no timestamps, a timed one carries
  `start_at`/`end_at` and no dates. Toggling therefore has to *derive* one from
  the other rather than set a flag.

  ## The exclusive end date

  `end_date` is stored exclusively, matching the iCal, Google and Outlook
  all-day convention and the grid's render filter, so a single-day all-day
  event has `end_date == start_date + 1`. Every conversion here translates
  between that exclusive boundary and the inclusive last day a timed event
  touches. Getting this wrong by one day is the classic all-day bug, which is
  why it lives in one place with the convention written down.

  ## Timezone handling

  Going from all-day to timed needs a wall-clock time, and 09:00-10:00 local is
  the arbitrary but reasonable default. A DST gap or ambiguity at those hours is
  extremely unlikely, and this is a programmatic toggle rather than something
  the user typed, so it resolves gracefully rather than failing, by the shared
  rule in `Tymeslot.Utils.DateTimeUtils.resolve_local/3`: a gap resolves to its
  end, an ambiguous time to its first occurrence.
