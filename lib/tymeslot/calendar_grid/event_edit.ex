defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEdit do
  @moduledoc """
  Editing an existing calendar-grid event: one change applied to the whole
  event, pushed to the provider, then written back to the cache.

  ## Why the whole event is sent

  Provider updates are full replaces, so a rename that sent only the title
  used to strip the event's attendees, reminders, repeat rule and colour. The
  payload is therefore always built by `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.ProviderPayload`
  from the complete event after the change is applied, never from the change
  alone. `changes` speaks the cache's vocabulary; that module is the one place
  it is translated into the adapters'.

  That keeps everything the cache models, which is not everything the event
  has: an event authored elsewhere carries properties Tymeslot never reads.
  For the CalDAV family the payload therefore travels with the cached
  `raw_ical` and its ETag, and the adapter patches that document property by
  property instead of rebuilding it, so an `ATTENDEE` block with its
  `PARTSTAT`, categories and `X-` properties survive an edit. Google and
  Outlook have no equivalent: their updates replace the event with the
  payload, and what the cache does not model is still lost there.

  Attendees are the one exception to "always the whole event". Outlook's
  update is a `PATCH` and a patched CalDAV document keeps what the payload
  leaves out, so on those writes the guest list is sent only by an edit that
  changes it: a Graph `PATCH` that carries attendees resets every reply, and
  a CalDAV write that carries them states the new complete list.

  ## Recurring events on the CalDAV family

  A CalDAV series lives in one resource: the master VEVENT carrying the
  `RRULE`, plus a VEVENT per occurrence that has been edited on its own. The
  sync never stores that master — it expands it into one cached row per
  occurrence, all sharing the series' href — and
  `ICalBuilder.Patcher.patch/2` applies the payload to the master and skips
  every `RECURRENCE-ID` override. So the write for any one occurrence lands
  on the whole series.

  Nor is that limited to a reschedule. The payload is always the complete
  event, so it always carries the occurrence's own `DTSTART` and `DTEND`:
  renaming "this Tuesday" rewrites the master's start to that Tuesday and
  drops every earlier occurrence, exactly as dragging it would. There is no
  edit of a CalDAV occurrence that stays inside the occurrence, so
  `ensure_editable/1` refuses all of them, the way
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventDeletion.ensure_deletable/1` refuses the delete
  and `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventMove.ensure_movable/1` refuses the move.

  They come back when the writer can author a `RECURRENCE-ID` override into
  the series' document. Google and Outlook address an occurrence by its own
  id and are unaffected, which is why the refusal is scoped to the provider
  rather than to recurrence alone.

  ## Failure

  A failed provider write is queued for replay when the error is one a retry
  can recover (see `Calendar.Events.queueable_error?/1`) and the integration
  has an offline queue (the CalDAV family). A queued edit is also written to
  the cache, so the grid keeps showing what the organiser saved.

  Applies `changes` to `event`, writes the whole updated event to the
  provider, and records the edit on the cached row.

  `changes` may only carry #{Enum.map_join(@editable_fields, ", ", &"`#{&1}`")};
  any other key raises `ArgumentError`. Timing follows the event's resulting `all_day`
  flag: an all-day event keeps its dates and drops its timestamps, a timed
  event the reverse. A change that flips `all_day` also refits the `UNTIL` of
  a recurring event's rule to the value type its new `DTSTART` calls for.

  ## Options

    * `:recurrence_scope` - which occurrences of a recurring series the edit
      is meant for (`"this_only"`, `"following"`, `"all"`). Forwarded to the
      provider payload; no provider acts on it yet.
    * `:conference_data` - a change to a Google event's own conference, sent
      with the write: a `createRequest` from
      `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Google.ConferenceData.create_request/0`,
      or `ConferenceData.remove/0`. Without it the event's conference is left
      as it is.
    * `:timezone` - the organiser's timezone. A timed event's `UNTIL` is an
      instant (RFC 5545 §3.3.10), so refitting one has to end the organiser's
      chosen day in their own zone; without it the day ends in UTC and the
      series gains or loses its last occurrence.

  Returns `{:ok, updated_event}`, or `{:error, %{reason: reason, retry:
  :queued | :not_queued}}` where `:queued` means the edit is saved locally
  and will be replayed on the next sync. An edit of a CalDAV series
  occurrence is refused with `:recurring_event` before anything is written;
  see `ensure_editable/1`.

  Whether `event` may be edited from the grid: a CalDAV-family event that
  belongs to a series may not, anything else may.

  Every write for such an event is patched onto the series' master VEVENT,
  and the payload always carries the occurrence's own timing, so no edit of
  one occurrence can stay inside it (see the moduledoc). The series test is
  the one a move uses, `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Recurrence.Series.member?/1`;
  the provider test is what keeps Google and Outlook, which address an
  occurrence by its own id, editable.

  Takes a cached row or a normalised event: the provider is read in either
  its string or atom form, and the series markers in either key shape.
