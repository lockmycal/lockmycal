defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideo do
  @moduledoc """
  Changing the video room of an existing calendar-grid event: provisioning a
  room on the chosen video integration, or removing the link altogether.

  ## Where the link lives

  One link is published, since a calendar event's description is one piece of
  text everybody it reaches shares. `join_link/2` is what that link is: the
  room's own URL on every provider whose links are plain addresses, and on
  one whose links carry a credential the room URL with a token naming nobody.

  It is written in two places, as when an event is created from the grid
  (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventCreation`):

    * on the provider event, as a "Join video call" line in the description,
      so the organiser's calendar and its attendees see it. The line for the
      previous link is replaced rather than left behind. The write goes
      through `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEdit`, so the whole event is sent
      and a failed write is queued for retry like any other edit;
    * on the cached row, as `video_link` and `video_integration_id`. Inbound
      syncs never carry these two columns, so they are written with the
      targeted local edit rather than the sync's full-row upsert, which would
      silently ignore them.

  ## Google Meet from the calendar's own account

  On a Google event whose chosen Meet integration shares the calendar's Google
  account, Google makes the conference itself, as it does when the event is
  created from the grid (`Tymeslot.Integrations.MeetingProvisioning`). The
  update asks for one with `conferenceData` and `conferenceDataVersion=1`,
  the event is read back once for the link Google made, and no line is added
  to the description. Moving such an event to another room, or to "None",
  takes the conference off in the same write, so the event's Meet button does
  not stay beside the new link.

  ## Microsoft Teams from the calendar's own account

  A Teams meeting is an Outlook event with an online meeting switched on. On
  an Outlook event whose chosen Teams integration shares the calendar's
  Microsoft account, the meeting is switched on for the event itself, as for
  a booking and for an event created from the grid
  (`MeetingProvisioning.plan/3`'s `:attach`), rather than written as a second
  event beside it. The previous room's line leaves the description first,
  then the Teams provider attaches the meeting to the event by its Outlook
  id; Outlook adds the meeting's own join details to the event, so no line is
  written for it.

  Microsoft Graph cannot take an online meeting off an event again. Moving
  such an event to another room, or to "None", therefore leaves the Teams
  meeting on the Outlook event: its join button stays beside the new link
  until the organiser removes it in Outlook. The meeting is never deleted as
  a room, since deleting it would delete the event (see
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoDiscard`).

  ## Rooms

  A room that is no longer referenced (the one just replaced or removed, or a
  new one that could not be put on the event) is deleted through
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoDiscard`, which queues the delete with
  retries: by the room's record where `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms`
  keeps one, otherwise by the id in its link where that is exact (Zoom).
  Rooms of any other provider are left in place.

  is the only link a server enforcing tokens admits: the bare URL it refuses,
  organiser included.

  `start_at` dates the token, and anything that is not a `DateTime` (an
  all-day event's `Date`, or nothing at all) leaves the provider to date it
  from now. A recurring event's token is dated from the series' first
  occurrence, and an event moved later is not relinked, so on a token
  provider both outlive their link; on such a server the bare URL they would
  otherwise carry works no better.

  Falls back to the room's own URL whenever no link comes back, which is what
