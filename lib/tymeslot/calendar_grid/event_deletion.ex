defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventDeletion do
  @moduledoc """
  Deleting a calendar-grid event: the provider delete, the Tymeslot meeting
  it may have been booked as, and the cached row the grid reads. Whenever the
  row changes, the organiser's cached availability is invalidated so the
  booking page stops treating the slot as taken.

  ## Linked meetings

  An event that is the calendar copy of a Tymeslot booking takes the booking
  with it: once the provider has deleted the event, the meeting is reconciled
  as externally deleted (see `Calendar.Events.delete_event_and_reconcile/4`),
  and the result says whether that cancellation went through. Nothing is
  reconciled when the delete fails.

  ## Recurring events

  A member of a series is deleted in one of two scopes, `:occurrence` (this
  event) or `:series` (all of them), and `deletion_scopes/1` says whether an
  event takes one. Both read the cached row rather than the event they were
  handed, because callers pass only the fields that address the event.

    * Google and Outlook give every occurrence an id of its own, so an
      occurrence is deleted by that id and the series by its master's.
    * The CalDAV family holds a whole series in one resource. An occurrence is
      deleted by rewriting the resource without it (see
      `Calendar.Events.delete_event/3`), after which every other cached row of
      the resource carries the new document. The series is deleted with the
      resource.
    * Exchange has no scoped delete, so its series are refused with
      `:recurring_event`.

  A series is never a Tymeslot booking, so deleting any part of one
  reconciles no meeting, and a room the series shares stays until the whole
  series goes.

  ## Telling the attendees

  With `notify_attendees: true` the attendees are sent a cancellation once
  the provider has deleted the event, built from the cached row as it was
  (see `AttendeeNotifications.event_deleted_confirm/3`), and the result says
  whether it went out as `:attendees_notified`. Nothing is sent for a delete
  that failed or was queued for a retry, since the event is still in the
  calendar, nor for a booking, whose cancelled meeting tells its attendee
  itself.

  ## Failure

  A failed delete is queued for replay on the next sync when the error is one
  a retry can recover (see `Calendar.Events.queueable_error?/1`) and the
  integration has an offline queue (the CalDAV family). The queue marks the
  cached row `locally_deleted`, and the replay removes it once the server has
  deleted the event.

  A failed delete of a series member is never queued: the queue replays a
  delete as a DELETE of the whole resource, which would widen a CalDAV
  occurrence delete to its series.

  Only a delete the calendar refused is reported as a failure. Once the
  provider has removed the event there is nothing left to retry, so the
  local tidying that follows (the linked meeting, the cached row, the
  organiser's cached availability) can fail without changing the answer: the
  failure is logged, and the delete still returns `{:ok, deleted}`. The
  linked meeting is the one such step the organiser is told about, as
  `:cancel_failed`.

  Deletes `event` from its calendar on behalf of `user_id`, cancels the
  meeting it was booked as, and removes its cached row.

  The event is addressed by its `:provider_event_id` when it has one, and by
  its iCal UID otherwise. For a member of a series, `scope` says whether the
  one occurrence or the whole series goes (see the moduledoc); it is ignored
  for any other event.

  `opts` takes `notify_attendees: true` to send the attendees a cancellation
  once the event is deleted (see the moduledoc).

  Returns `{:ok, deleted}`, or `{:error, %{reason: reason, retry: :queued |

  provider has no scoped delete, and with `:unaddressable_occurrence` or
  `:unaddressable_series` when its cached row does not say which occurrence
  or series it is.
