defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventDeletion do
  @moduledoc """
  Deleting a calendar-grid event: the provider delete, the Tymeslot meeting
  it may have been booked as, and the cached row the grid reads. Whenever the
  row changes, the organiser's cached availability is invalidated so the
  booking page stops treating the slot as taken.

  ## Linked meetings

  An event that is the calendar copy of a Tymeslot booking takes the booking
  with it: once the provider has deleted the event, the meeting is reconciled
  as externally deleted (see `Calendar.Events.delete_event_and_reconcile/4`),
  and the result says whether that cancellation went through. Nothing is
  reconciled when the delete fails.

  ## Recurring events

  An event that belongs to a series is refused with `:recurring_event`. For
  the CalDAV family every occurrence is addressed by the one resource that
  holds the whole series, so deleting "this Tuesday" would delete every
  occurrence on the organiser's calendar, and no provider has a scoped delete
  yet. The check reads the cached row rather than the event it was handed,
  because callers pass only the fields that address the event.

  ## Failure

  A failed delete is queued for replay on the next sync when the error is one
  a retry can recover (see `Calendar.Events.queueable_error?/1`) and the
  integration has an offline queue (the CalDAV family). The queue marks the
  cached row `locally_deleted`, and the replay removes it once the server has
  deleted the event.

  Only a delete the calendar refused is reported as a failure. Once the
  provider has removed the event there is nothing left to retry, so the
  local tidying that follows (the linked meeting, the cached row, the
  organiser's cached availability) can fail without changing the answer: the
  failure is logged, and the delete still returns `{:ok, deleted}`. The
  linked meeting is the one such step the organiser is told about, as
  `:cancel_failed`.
