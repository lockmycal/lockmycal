defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventCreation do
  @moduledoc """
  Domain orchestration for creating calendar-grid events.

  Takes plain payload maps (never a LiveView socket) and is invoked from a
  supervised Task. Responsibilities:

    * build iCal event data from the dashboard create form,
    * plan and attach video-conference data (inline Google Meet, a Teams
      meeting attached to the Outlook event once it is written, or a
      separately-provisioned room),
    * call the calendar provider via `Calendar.Events`, queueing a failed
      create for offline retry,
    * drop the organiser's cached availability so the newly blocked time
      stops being offered on the booking page,
    * fire attendee notifications, and
    * look up integration metadata for the cache row.

  Side effects that need to reach the user (e.g. a "reconnect your calendar"
  flash) are surfaced as data in the returned `{:ok, result}` map — never via
  `send/2` back into the LiveView — because this code runs in a Task process
  whose mailbox the LiveView never reads. The web layer maps those flags to
  flashes.
