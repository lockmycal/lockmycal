defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoDiscard do
  @moduledoc """
  Deletes the video room a calendar grid event no longer uses: the one a video
  change replaced or removed, a new one that could not be put on the event, or
  the room of an event that was deleted.

  The delete never runs inline. It is queued on
  `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker`, which retries a failure and treats a
  room the provider no longer has as deleted.

  ## Which id

  A room `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms` recorded is deleted by that
  record, which holds the id the provider gave when the room was made.

  Any other room is only known by its join link. Its id is parsed back out of
  the link only where that is exact, which is Zoom alone: the meeting id in
  `/j/<id>` is the id the delete addresses. Google Meet's link names a meeting
  code rather than the space it was created as, and the Meet API has no call
  that deletes a space anyway; MiroTalk and custom links have no room object
  to delete. Those rooms are left where they are, with an `info` line naming
  the room by `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.Logging.Redactor.fingerprint/1` only.

  A Teams room is an Outlook event, and its link does not carry that event's
  id. The separate event a Teams meeting gets when it cannot be attached to
  the grid event is recorded, and deleted by its record like any other. One
  attached to the grid event itself (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideo`) is
  never recorded, since its id is the grid event's own and deleting that room
  would delete the event, so it is left in place, by its id as well as by its
  link.

  Leaving the rest is also what keeps deletion no more aggressive than the
  notification an attendee gets: an attendee who still holds a replaced
  MiroTalk link can still join, as before.

  ## A room another event still uses

  A room known only by its link is left in place while any other cached event
  still carries that link from the same integration. A move whose original
  could not be deleted leaves two events holding one Zoom meeting, and so
  does every occurrence of a series; deleting or re-linking one of them must
  not take the meeting from the others.
