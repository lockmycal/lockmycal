defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRoomExpiry do
  @moduledoc """
  Decides whether a calendar grid event's video room has outlived its event
  and may be deleted.

  A room's recorded end can be stale: the event may have been moved, made
  recurring or deleted in a calendar client, where the grid never hears of it.
  Deleting a conversation still in use leaves attendees with a dead join link,
  while keeping one too long only leaves it in the organiser's list, so a room
  is deleted only on positive evidence that its event is over, and kept
  whenever that evidence cannot be had.

  The decision takes two steps.

  `check/1` is the nightly scan's, and reads only the calendar cache, so the
  scan stays cheap:

    * An event still cached that ends later brings the room's times up to
      date, and the room is kept.
    * An event still cached that recurs is kept, with its end widened, or
      cleared when no later end is known, so the scan stops offering it.
    * An event cached as ended, or absent from a calendar that has synced
      successfully since the room fell due, passes on to the job.

  `confirm/1` is the job's, run just before it deletes. It repeats the cache
  check, then asks the calendar provider for the event itself, since the
  cache holds only a year either side of today and only the calendars the
  organiser selected:

    * Found and ending later, or recurring: kept, and the room follows it.
    * Found and still over: deleted.
    * Not found (a 404 or 410, or for Google and Outlook a cancelled event):
      deleted. Outlook changes an event's id when it moves to another
      calendar, so it confirms a 404 by the iCalendar UID the event's cached
      row carries, and without one the event is kept.
    * Any error, timeout or refused credentials: kept, and the next scan asks
      again.
    * A provider that cannot fetch one event (Exchange, and the read-only
      subscription and demo calendars): deleted only when the cache still
      holds the event as ended, and otherwise kept.
