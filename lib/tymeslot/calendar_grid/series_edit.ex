defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.SeriesEdit do
  @moduledoc """
  Editing a member of a recurring series from the grid, in one of the scopes
  of `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.RecurrenceScope`: this event, this and every
  following one, or all of them.

  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEdit.update_event/4` routes an edit here when
  the cached row belongs to a series. What a scope takes depends on how the
  row's provider addresses part of a series, which
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.Occurrence.series_family/1` answers once for edits
  and deletes alike:

    * **Google and Outlook** give every occurrence an id of its own. An edit
      of this event only is written to that id, exactly like an edit of a
      one-off event. An edit of all events is written to the series' master,
      named by the occurrence's `recurring_event_id` (see *What every Google
      or Outlook occurrence can take*), and an edit of this and every
      following event splits the series in two there (see *What this and
      every following Google or Outlook occurrence can take*).
    * **The CalDAV family** holds a whole series in one resource. An edit of
      this event only is written as the occurrence's `RECURRENCE-ID` override
      in that resource (see `Calendar.Events.update_event/3`), and every
      cached row of the resource is given the document the server now holds.
      An edit of all events is written to the series' master, and moves the
      whole series when the occurrence moved (see *What every CalDAV
      occurrence can take*). An edit of this and every following event
      splits the series in two there (see *What this and every following
      CalDAV occurrence can take*).
    * **Exchange** has no scoped write. An edit of this event is written to
      the item's own id, as it always has been, and the grid does not ask
      for a scope (`edit_scopes/1` answers `:this_only`); the wider scopes
      are refused with `:unsupported_scope`.

  ## What one CalDAV occurrence can take

  The override carries only what the edit changed, plus the occurrence's
  timing: whatever else the occurrence has is already in the override the
  writer starts from, the master's own lines or an earlier override, and is
  kept as the server wrote it rather than rewritten from the cache. Two edits
  are refused before anything is written, since they are not edits of one
  occurrence: a change of repeat rule (`:unsupported_scope`; the rule belongs
  to the series) and turning one occurrence all-day or back
  (`:value_type_change`; RFC 5545 allows it, but servers disagree about it).

  ## What every CalDAV occurrence can take

  The master takes the fields the edit changed, and a new repeat rule. A
  move of the occurrence moves the series by as much, on the wall clock of
  its zone, with every exception and override (see
  `ICalBuilder.Series.edit_master/5`). A weekly rule's weekdays turn with a
  move to another day; a rule that pins its occurrences in a way a move
  cannot follow, such as the second Monday of the month, refuses it.
  Removing the repeat rule
  is refused (`:unsupported_scope`), as is turning the series all-day or
  back (`:value_type_change`).

  The document the server now holds could move every occurrence, so the
  series' cached rows are not patched: they are deleted, and a full sync of
  the integration is requested, the one the dashboard's Refresh asks for
  (`Tymeslot.Workers.SyncCalDavCalendarWorker.enqueue_full_fetch/1`), which
  brings the series back as the server holds it. What no sync brings back,
  the series' video and the organiser's colour overrides on its occurrences,
  is carried across by `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.SeriesCarry`, as it is after
  every write below that drops the series' rows.

  ## What this and every following CalDAV occurrence can take

  The same as every occurrence, applied to the occurrences from the edited
  one on. The series is split in two there (`CalDAV.Events.split_series/4`):
  the occurrences from the edited one on move to a new resource in the same
  calendar, which takes the edit, and the series' own resource ends before
  them. An edit of the series' first occurrence is an edit of every
  occurrence, and is written as one. The series' rows are then deleted and a
  full sync requested, as for an edit of every occurrence, which brings back
  both halves; the series' recorded video rooms move to the new resource,
  whose occurrences carry its join link on
  (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms.series_split/3`).

  ## What every Google or Outlook occurrence can take

  The same as every CalDAV occurrence, written to the master the provider
  keeps: the master is read, and patched with only what the edit changed,
  never rewritten from the occurrence, which would take the master's
  recurrence, reminders and zone with it (`Google.SeriesPatch`,
  `Outlook.SeriesPatch`). A move of the occurrence, from where it shows now,
  moves the master by as much on the wall clock of its own zone, and the
  repeat rule and the dates the series excludes follow it. Occurrences
  edited on their own in the provider are not moved; the provider keeps or
  drops them. A master row, which names no master, is refused with
  `:unaddressable_occurrence`, as its delete is.

  The series' rows, the master's own included, are then deleted and a sync
  of the integration requested, the one the dashboard's Refresh asks for
  (`SyncGoogleCalendarWorker.enqueue/1`, `RefreshOutlookCalendarWorker.enqueue/1`).

  ## What this and every following Google or Outlook occurrence can take

  The same as every occurrence, applied to the occurrences from the edited
  one on. The series is split at the occurrence's original start, where the
  series put it (`Occurrence.original_start/1`): the occurrences from there
  on are written as a new series, which takes the edit, and the master is
  then ended before them (`Google.SeriesSplit`, `Outlook.SeriesSplit`). If
  the master cannot be ended, the new series is deleted again and the edit
  fails. An edit of the series' first occurrence is an edit of every
  occurrence, and is written as one.

  The new series is a copy of the master's own fields, not of the provider's
  bookkeeping: Google's Meet link is copied as it is, while an Outlook
  series' Teams meeting is not (creating one would make a new meeting),
  though the join details in its description are. A repeat count the grid
  cannot count as the provider does, such as the second Monday of the month
  for ten months, is refused (`:unsupported_rule`) before anything is
  written.

  Occurrences from the split on that were edited or cancelled on their own
  are read before anything is written and carried to the new series once
  it is (`Recurrence.SplitExceptions`): each keeps what it had of its own,
  moved with the series, and a cancelled one stays cancelled. Only one
  whose place a new repeat rule no longer has cannot be carried, which the
  organiser is told before choosing the scope (`following_notes/2`). A
  write that fails after the split is logged, and the edit still succeeds.

  The series' rows are then deleted and a sync requested, as for an edit of
  every occurrence, which brings back both halves; the series' recorded video
  rooms move to the new series, whose occurrences carry its join link on
  (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms.series_split/3`).

  ## Failure

  A failed write of a series member is never queued for offline replay. The
  CalDAV offline queue refuses to replay a series member, so a queued edit
  would sit in the queue for good while the grid showed it as saved; Google
  and Outlook have no offline queue. A failed write leaves the cached rows
  as they were and requests no sync.
