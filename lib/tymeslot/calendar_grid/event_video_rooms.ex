defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRooms do
  @moduledoc """
  Keeps track of the video rooms made for events created on the dashboard
  calendar grid, so the rooms that would otherwise stay on the organiser's
  server for ever are deleted, and never one still in use.

  A booking's room is held by its `meetings` row, which every clean-up path
  works from. A grid event lives only in the organiser's calendar, so the room
  is recorded here when it is made, for the providers whose rooms have to
  follow their event (`ProviderConfig.rooms_recorded_for_grid_events/0`):

    * A room that persists until something deletes it
      (`ProviderConfig.rooms_deleted_after_meeting/0`, Nextcloud Talk).
      `Tymeslot.Workers.ExpiredVideoRoomCleanupWorker` deletes it some days
      after its event has ended, once the calendar confirms it
      (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRoomExpiry`), and disconnecting the
      integration with its rooms deletes it too.
    * A room that is an event of its own in the organiser's calendar
      (`ProviderConfig.room_held_as_calendar_event?/1`): the separate Outlook
      event a Teams meeting gets when it cannot be attached to the grid event
      itself. Its join link does not name that event, so the record is the only
      way back to it. It is an ordinary meeting once its time has passed, so
      neither the nightly clean-up nor a disconnect deletes it.

  The record follows the event through the grid: moving the event moves the
  record's times, and the room's lobby, or its event, with them; replacing the
  event's video or deleting a one-off event deletes the room.

  A Teams meeting attached to the grid event itself is never recorded. Its
  room id is the event's own Outlook id, so it moves and goes with the event
  through the calendar, and deleting it as a room would delete the event.

  ## Which event a room belongs to

  The room is never read back out of the event's description or location. The
  organiser can edit that text in any calendar client, and a room found there
  need not be one Tymeslot created.

  Instead the record holds the event's identifiers within its calendar
  integration, and matches an event that shares any of them, as
  `Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventLink` does for bookings: the uid Tymeslot
  generated, which CalDAV servers keep, and the identifier the provider
  returned, which Google and Outlook cache as `provider_event_id`. Occurrences
  of a series are matched too: Google and Outlook cache them with their
  parent's id in `recurring_event_id`, and CalDAV under the series uid followed
  by `_` and the occurrence's start.

  ## Erring towards keeping a room

  A conversation deleted while still in use leaves attendees with a dead join
  link; one kept too long only lingers in the organiser's list. So a room is
  deleted only when its event is known to be over:

    * Deleting an occurrence of a series, or moving one to another calendar,
      leaves the room with the series.
    * The times a room keeps only ever widen for a series
      (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventVideoRoomTimes`).
    * Before an ended room is deleted, the cached calendar is consulted, since
      the event may have been moved or made recurring outside the grid.
