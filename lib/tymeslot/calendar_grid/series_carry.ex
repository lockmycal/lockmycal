defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.SeriesCarry do
  @moduledoc """
  Carries what only Tymeslot knows about a recurring series across a write
  that drops the series' cached rows for a sync to bring back: an edit of
  every occurrence, a split for an edit of one occurrence and every following
  one (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.SeriesEdit`), and a move of the whole series to
  another calendar (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.SeriesTransfer`). A series just
  created from the grid is carried the same way into its first sync.

  Two things about a series live in Tymeslot alone:

    * its video, the `video_link` and `video_integration_id` of its rows. No
      sync writes them: `ProviderCalendarEventQueries.replace_fields/0` leaves
      them out, so that a row the sync updates keeps them, but a row the sync
      inserts has none;
    * the organiser's colour overrides (`Calendar.set_event_colour/3`), each
      keyed by the uid one occurrence is cached under.

  `plan/3` reads both from the series' rows, and so runs before they are
  deleted; `carry/1` writes them once they are. A write that has reached the
  calendar cannot be undone, so neither step may fail it: each is rescued
  and logged, and a plan that could not be read carries nothing.

  ## The series' video

  What is carried is the series' own video: the one on the row the grid
  caches for the series as a whole (its master's row, or a CalDAV row under
  the series' own UID), otherwise the one more than half of its rows carry.
  A video one occurrence was given on its own is not spread to the rest of
  the series. The video goes to every part of the series as the write left
  it: the series itself after an edit of every occurrence, both halves of a
  split, and the series on the calendar it moved to.

  The sync that brings the series back runs on its own, so the video cannot
  be written onto its rows yet, and their uids are not all known. It is
  handed to `Tymeslot.Workers.SeriesVideoWorker`, which waits until a sync
  has cached occurrences of the series where it now lives and gives every
  one without a video of its own the series' (see
  `ProviderCalendarSeriesQueries.put_video/5`). From then on they keep it,
  as every row keeps its video through a sync.

  A Teams meeting switched on for an Outlook event itself stays with the
  event it was made for: an Outlook series moved to another calendar is a
  copy without it (see `SeriesTransfer`), so its link is not carried there.

  ## Colour overrides

  An override is moved to the uid its occurrence will be cached under,
  which is derived from the uid it had, how far the series moved, and the
  uid of the series it now belongs to, never from a later read of the cache,
  which does not hold the new rows yet. Google and the CalDAV family cache an
  occurrence under its series' UID and a stamp of the slot the series put it
  in: Google `<UID>_<original start in UTC>`, CalDAV `<UID>_<start on the
  series' wall clock>`, or a date for an all-day series. A move of the series
  moves every slot by as much on the series' wall clock, and a split or a
  move to another calendar gives the occurrences a series of their own, so:

    * after an edit of every occurrence that moved it, each stamp moves as
      the series did;
    * after a split, the occurrences from the edited one on take the new
      series' UID, their stamps moved as the edit moved the occurrence; the
      earlier ones keep theirs;
    * after a move to another calendar, every occurrence takes the new
      series' UID on the integration it moved to.

  An occurrence whose uid carries no stamp has nothing to follow it by.
  Outlook caches every occurrence under an iCalendar UID of its own, which a
  moved or copied series replaces, so an override on an Outlook occurrence is
  kept only where its occurrence keeps its uid (an edit that does not move
  the series, or the earlier half of a split), and is otherwise deleted, as
  one on any other occurrence with no successor is. An override whose moved
  key names an occurrence the series no longer has matches nothing, as it
  would have after any other change to the series outside the grid.
