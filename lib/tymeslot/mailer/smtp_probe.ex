defmodule Tymeslot.Mailer.SmtpProbe do
  @moduledoc """
  SMTP server reachability probe used during mailer health checks.

  Resolves the configured host's DNS, opens the connection a send would open
  (implicit TLS, or plain TCP upgraded with STARTTLS), validates the SMTP
  greeting (220 response code), and completes the TLS handshake with the
  same certificate checks a send applies. Closes the socket cleanly with QUIT. Returns
  human-readable error messages with port-specific troubleshooting hints
  when the probe fails.

  This probe never sends an email and never authenticates — credentials are
  only validated on the first real send.
