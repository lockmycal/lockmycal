defmodule Tymeslot.AppSettings.LockoutPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  Refuses any settings update that would leave an install with no way for an
  admin to sign in.

  Lives apart from `Tymeslot.AppSettings`, which owns reading, writing and
  projecting settings: this is an authentication policy that happens to be
  enforced on a settings write, and it was roughly two fifths of that module.

  Two evaluation points, deliberately different:

    * the **commit path**, where `AppSettings` passes this as the guard
      callback to `AppSettingsQueries.update_settings/3`. It runs inside the
      `FOR UPDATE` transaction against the merged, about-to-be-committed row,
      so two concurrent admin saves serialise on the row lock and the second
      sees the first one's effect.
    * the **read path**, where the admin UI asks which toggles to grey out in
      advance. That one evaluates against the current row plus the proposed
      attributes, and carries no consistency risk: the authoritative check
      still runs under the lock.

  `would_cause_lockout?/2` also carries the `meeting_payments_enabled` guard:
  not an authentication path, but this is the only point `update/1` checks
  the merged, about-to-be-committed row, so a race-conditioned enable with no
  Stripe platform credentials configured is refused here too rather than
  only being greyed out in the UI.
