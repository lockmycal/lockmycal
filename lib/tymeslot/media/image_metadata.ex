defmodule Tymeslot.Media.ImageMetadata do
  @moduledoc """
  Re-encodes uploaded images without their metadata, so nothing a camera or
  phone embedded (EXIF GPS coordinates, capture time, device model and serial
  number, XMP, IPTC, PNG text chunks) is published with them under `/uploads`.

  The pixels are rotated upright first: stripping the EXIF Orientation tag
  without applying it would turn portrait phone photos sideways. Only the ICC
  colour profile is kept, because dropping it shifts the colours of wide-gamut
  photos and it identifies nothing.

  Animated GIF and WebP keep every frame, their timing and their loop count.
  Their frames are not auto-rotated: libvips stacks the frames into one tall
  image, which a rotation would scramble, and animations do not carry an
  orientation in practice.

  Re-encoding rather than editing the file in place also means a crafted file
  never reaches disk as it was sent. It is not a validator: callers check the
  upload's magic bytes first, and run this afterwards, so a crafted file cannot
  use the encoder to get past that check.

  Re-encoding keeps the quality the upload had. JPEG and lossy WebP are
  written at quality 90, well above the encoders' default of 75, so a stripped
  photo is not visibly worse than the one sent; a lossless WebP stays
  lossless and a palette PNG stays a palette PNG, so neither changes a pixel.
  GIF needs nothing: the encoder keeps the colours of an image that already
  has 256 or fewer exactly.

  Decoding is the expensive part, so strips run one at a time on each node:
  concurrent uploads queue rather than each claiming the memory of a full
  decode.
