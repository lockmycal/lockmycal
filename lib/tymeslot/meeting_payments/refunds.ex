defmodule Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.Refunds do
  @moduledoc """
  Issues refunds against `booking_payments` rows via the Stripe Refund
  API and reconciles the local row.

  The contract shared by `issue_refund/3` (system refunds, unscoped) and
  `issue_host_refund/4` (a host refunding a payment they took):

    * Validates the payment is within the 60-day refund window.
    * Validates the requested amount is positive and does not exceed
      the remaining refundable balance.
    * Calls Stripe with an idempotency key keyed on the payment id,
      cumulative refunded total after this refund, and the requested
      amount — so a true retry collapses while a fresh attempt at a
      different amount produces a fresh Stripe call.
    * Conditionally passes `refund_application_fee: true` only when
      the original charge had a non-zero application fee. Stripe
      errors if asked to refund a fee that was never collected.
    * Updates the local `booking_payments` row, transitioning status
      to `partially_refunded` or `refunded` based on the new total.
    * Synchronously enqueues an attendee refund email via
      `Tymeslot.Workers.SendBookingPaymentRefunded`.
