defmodule Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.ConnectAccounts do
  @moduledoc """
  Stripe Connect lifecycle for hosts.

  Owns the placeholder-first onboarding flow: a row is persisted before
  Stripe is ever called so that a crash mid-flight cannot orphan a real
  Stripe account. The Stripe API call itself is idempotency-keyed by that
  placeholder row, which makes a retry after a crash safe: a retry reuses
  the same placeholder (and thus the same key) until the account is
  created, so Stripe returns the already-created account instead of a
  duplicate. A definite (non-crash) error from Stripe deletes the
  placeholder instead of leaving it in place — Stripe caches an idempotent
  key's response, errors included, for 24h, so reusing the same key on the
  next attempt would just replay the same failure even after the underlying
  problem is fixed (or the host picked a different country). Deleting it
  gives the next attempt a fresh placeholder id and therefore a fresh key.

  The same reasoning applies when the account exists (the `create_account`
  step succeeded, possibly on an earlier attempt) but Stripe reports it gone
  by the time `create_account_link` runs — e.g. the connected account was
  deleted from the Stripe dashboard. Retrying would keep failing on the
  now-dangling account id, so that specific error also deletes the row.

  Starts (or resumes) Stripe Connect onboarding for `user`.

  Enforces the feature gate itself, so a forged request cannot start
  onboarding whatever the caller checked: the error is the
  `Tymeslot.Features.check_access/2` reason (`:feature_disabled`,

  counts as allowed, since establishing the account is what this flow is for.

  A host whose row already carries a Stripe account (they left the hosted
  onboarding part-way and came back) gets a fresh onboarding link for that

  `{:error, :account_creation_restricted}` when Stripe has put a temporary
  hold on the platform creating connected accounts.

  `normalize_country/2`), defaulting to the operator's default. A new
  account is prefilled with the user's email so Connect Onboarding doesn't
  ask the host to type it again.

  Disconnects the host's Stripe account.

  Performs three steps in order so attendees cannot complete payment after
  the account is gone:

    1. Collect pending booking_payments for this host (no lock needed).
    2. Expire each open Stripe Checkout Session (HTTP calls, outside any
       DB transaction to avoid holding the connection open).
    3. Atomic transaction: mark each booking_payment as `failed` (conditional
       UPDATE — only when `status = 'pending'`, so a concurrent
       `checkout.session.completed` webhook that has already moved the row to
       `paid` is not overwritten), transition the linked `awaiting_payment`
       meeting to `expired`, then soft-delete the connect_account row.

  Returns `{:ok, %{cancelled_count: n, outstanding_refunds_count: m}}` on
  success, `{:error, reason}` if the transaction fails.

  ## Outstanding refunds

  `outstanding_refunds_count` is measured before the soft delete and is not
  acted on: these are cancelled bookings whose money the host still holds, and
  disconnecting neither settles nor cancels them. It is reported because the
  disconnect is the moment the host loses the ability to issue them from
  Tymeslot (from here on only their Stripe dashboard can settle them), so the
  caller can say so rather than let the obligation disappear quietly.

  ## Race with checkout.session.completed

  The conditional `UPDATE … WHERE status = 'pending'` in step 3 means a
  `checkout.session.completed` webhook that has already flipped a row to `paid`
  will not be overwritten — the update silently skips that row, and
  `cancelled_count` reflects only the rows that were actually cancelled.

  If the webhook arrives *after* step 3 sets the meeting to `expired`, the
  `CheckoutSessionCompleted.ensure_awaiting_payment/1` guard will find the
  meeting in `expired` status and return `:no_op`, leaving the payment untouched.

  ## Stripe session expiry failures

  Stripe session expiry is best-effort. If a call fails (network error, session
  already expired/completed) we log and continue — the meeting and booking_payment
  are cancelled locally regardless, so the attendee cannot complete the booking
  even if the Stripe session is still technically open.

  ## Paid meeting types are left alone

  Deliberately: `payment_required` and `price_cents` survive a disconnect so a
  host who reconnects gets their prices back instead of re-entering every one.
  The form no longer clears them by omission
  (`Tymeslot.MeetingTypes.FormMapper.build_attrs/2`), the changeset no longer
  fails unrelated saves over the stored flag
  (`MeetingTypeSchema.validate_payment_fields/2`), and `Bookings.Create`
  refuses a paid booking outright while charges are off, so nothing is taken
  in the meantime. Clearing them here, as `MeetingPayments.change_default_currency/2`
  does for a currency change, would destroy that state for the far more common
  case of a temporary disconnect.
