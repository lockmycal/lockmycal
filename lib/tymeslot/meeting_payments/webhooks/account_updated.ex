defmodule Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.Webhooks.AccountUpdated do
  @moduledoc """
  Handler for the Stripe `account.updated` Connect event.

  Delegates the heavy lifting to `Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.ConnectAccounts.apply_account_event/2`,
  which owns the out-of-order ordering guard via `last_account_event_at`
  and the `disabled_reason`/`charges_enabled` reconciliation. The webhook
  layer unwraps the Stripe envelope, passing the account object plus the
  **event envelope's** `created` as the ordering timestamp.

  Idempotent by virtue of the timestamp guard inside `apply_account_event/2` —
  a replayed event carries the same envelope `created` and produces the same
  end state.
