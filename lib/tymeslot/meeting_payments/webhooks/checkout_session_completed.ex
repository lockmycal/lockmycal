defmodule Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.Webhooks.CheckoutSessionCompleted do
  @moduledoc """
  Handler for the Stripe `checkout.session.completed` Connect event.

  Marks the matching `booking_payment` as paid, transitions the meeting
  from `awaiting_payment` to `confirmed`, and triggers the same
  side-effect pipeline (calendar push + confirmation emails) that the
  free booking flow uses. The whole state mutation runs inside a single
  `Repo.transaction/1` so a crash mid-flow rolls back cleanly.

  Idempotent — replaying an event whose id matches the stored
  `last_event_id` is a no-op, as is delivering an event for a meeting
  that is no longer in `awaiting_payment`. Also a no-op when the session's
  `payment_status` is not `"paid"` (an asynchronous payment method still
  settling), matching the gate `ReconcileAwaitingPayments.dispatch/2`
  applies when it replays this same event.

  # (`Policy.approval_attributes/2` stamps it at submission, even on the
  # paid path), and a host toggling `requires_approval` while a Stripe
  # Checkout session sits open — it can stay open 24h — must not silently
  # change what that invitee was told. Where the row was gated, the paid
  # booking moves into the approval gate rather than straight to confirmed,
  # and the host's clock starts here — they are only asked once the money
  # has actually cleared. Only the clock's *start* moves: its length is the
  # window stamped on the row at submission, replayed by
  # `Approval.restart_deadline/2`, so a host who set a 72-hour window still
  # gets 72 hours on a paid booking. Declining or letting it lapse refunds the full
  # remaining balance directly (`Meetings.Approval.after_release/1`); there
  # is no cancellation pipeline involved, because the attendee never got a
