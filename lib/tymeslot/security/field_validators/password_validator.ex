defmodule Tymeslot.Security.FieldValidators.PasswordValidator do
  @moduledoc """
  Password field validation with security requirements.

  Validates password complexity, length, and security patterns
  while providing specific feedback for security requirements.

  The rules live here as data (`rules/0`) rather than as a hand-written
  `cond`, because they have two audiences: this module enforces them, and the
  on-screen checklist has to state them. Those drifted apart once already, and
  the special-character rule was enforced while going unmentioned, so a
  password satisfying every rule the user could see was still rejected.

  Every message returned here reaches the person typing the password — the
  reset form, the signup form, the account security page — so each one resolves
  through the `auth` gettext domain at call time. The complexity messages are
  stored as msgids (`dgettext_noop/2`) because a `dgettext/2` call in a module
  attribute would freeze them at the compile-time locale.

  # Ordered as they are enforced, so the message names the first rule broken
  # and the checklist lists them in the same order it checks them. Each rule

  # keeps what we enforce and what we tell the user from drifting apart.
