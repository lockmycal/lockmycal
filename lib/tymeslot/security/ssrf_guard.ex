defmodule Tymeslot.Security.SsrfGuard do
  @moduledoc """
  Request-time SSRF validation for outbound HTTP requests to user-supplied
  hosts (CalDAV servers, self-hosted MiroTalk instances).

  Where `Tymeslot.Security.UrlValidation` runs at changeset/save time against
  the URL *string*, this guard runs immediately before the request leaves the
  application and additionally resolves the hostname via DNS (all A and AAAA
  records), rejecting it when any resolved address falls in a private, loopback,
  or link-local range (including the 169.254.169.254 cloud-metadata endpoint).

  **Connection pinning:** validating a hostname and then handing the URL string
  to Req/Finch would let Finch resolve that name a second time when it opens the
  socket, and a short-TTL record can answer public to the check and loopback to
  the connect. `validate_pinned/2` therefore returns the addresses it approved,
  and `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.HTTPClient` connects to one of them with the
  original hostname preserved for TLS and routing — see
  `Tymeslot.Security.ConnectionPinning`, which also documents the cases where
  pinning cannot apply and the request still travels by hostname. The
  multi-record variant of DNS-based SSRF is closed by checking every returned
  record before any of them is used.

  Enforcement is gated to `:prod` — the environment in which the managed SaaS
  and self-hosted deployments run — so that local development and tests can
  still target loopback CalDAV/video containers. Self-hosters who genuinely run
  an integration on a private network opt out per subsystem:

    * calendar — `config :tymeslot, :allow_private_ips_for_calendar, true`
      (`ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_CALENDAR=true`), read by `allow_private_for_calendar?/0`
    * video — `config :tymeslot, :allow_private_ips_for_video, true`
      (`ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_VIDEO=true`), read by `allow_private_for_video?/0`

  The calendar switch also satisfies video, but only while the video one is
  left unset; `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_VIDEO=false` is an answer about video and
  is not overruled by it. See `allow_private_for_video?/0`.

  Both bypasses are honoured at save time as well as at request time, so a URL
  the operator is allowed to reach is also a URL they are allowed to store.

  ## Plain http to an internal name

  With private addresses allowed, a server on an internal name (a single label
  such as a Docker service name, or a name under `.local`, `.lan`, `.internal`
  or `.home.arpa`) may be saved with plain `http://`, decided from the name's
  shape alone (see `Tymeslot.Security.UrlValidation`). The shape can be wrong:
  a resolver search domain can complete a single label to a public name, and
  nothing reserves `.lan`. Such requests carry credentials in clear text, so
  the opt-out does not skip resolution for them: the name must resolve only to
  private, loopback or link-local addresses, and the request is pinned to one
  of them, or it is refused before anything is sent. `https://`, `localhost`
  and address literals are unaffected.

  Returns `:ok` when the request is permitted (public host, non-prod

  The allowance defaults to the calendar opt-out; video call sites pass
  `allow_private: allow_private_for_video?()` so the two subsystems can be

  Same verdict as `validate/2`, but returns the addresses the check approved.

  Callers that open the connection themselves should use this and pin to one of

  window this module's moduledoc describes.

  An empty list means no address was resolved because none needed to be (the
  environment or an operator opt-out permitted the request on syntax alone),
  and there is correspondingly nothing to pin to. The one exception to the
  opt-out is plain http to an internal name, described in the moduledoc.

  Video is its own subsystem: a self-hoster running MiroTalk or their own

  Left unset, `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_CALENDAR` still satisfies video, because it
  shipped documented as covering both and revoking that would silently break the
  deployments already relying on it. Set, it decides alone: an operator who
  writes `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_VIDEO=false` has answered for video, and a
  calendar switch set for the calendar's sake must not quietly overrule them.

  `config/runtime.exs` is what keeps the two apart: it leaves the key absent for
  an unset or blank environment variable and writes the boolean for any other
