defmodule Tymeslot.Security.AccountLockout do
  @moduledoc """
  Account lockout mechanism to prevent brute force attacks.

  Uses ETS for fast, in-memory tracking of failed attempts. The ETS table is owned
  by `Tymeslot.Security.AccountLockout.TableOwner` and survives this module's
  caller crashing — but does NOT survive a BEAM restart, node shutdown, or deploy.

  ## One tier, deliberately

  There is a single defence here: once an identifier accumulates ten failures
  inside the last hour, further attempts are throttled until old failures age
  out of that window. There is no second, harder tier, and adding one would be
  a mistake for two reasons:

  - `RateLimiter.Auth.check_auth/2` consults `check_lockout_status/1` *before*
    password verification, and that check is read-only. Once the throttle
    threshold is reached the login path short-circuits and stops recording
    failures, so the counter freezes at the threshold and a higher one is
    unreachable by sequential brute force.
  - Making it reachable would mean recording attempts the pre-check already
    rejected, which turns the throttle into a lock anyone who can reach the
    login form can set off. A throttle that re-opens hourly degrades an
    attacker; a hard lock triggered the same way degrades the account owner.

  ## Keyed on the email and the client address

  `Tymeslot.Security.RateLimiter.Auth` passes an identifier of the form
  `"email|ip"` (for IPv6 the client's /64, which one host can rotate
  through freely), so failures from one address throttle only that address
  against that account, and the owner can still sign in from anywhere else.
  Keyed on the email alone, ten wrong guesses from anywhere locked the owner
  out of their own account for up to an hour. A run spread across many
  addresses is caught instead by the rate limiter's per-email ceiling (50
  attempts per 30 minutes, whatever the address), which only trips under a
  distributed attack. This module itself treats the identifier as opaque.

  A previous revision defined a 20-failure tier returning `:account_locked`
  with a flat four-hour duration. It was removed rather than repaired: it never
  fired under sequential brute force, and the only ways to make it fire are the
  denial-of-service above.
