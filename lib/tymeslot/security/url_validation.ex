  Shared HTTP/HTTPS URL validation helpers for security-sensitive inputs.

  ## The https rule and internal names

  `enforce_https_for_public: true` refuses plain `http://` for any host that is
  not local: `localhost`, a private or loopback IP literal, and the like. A name
  is never local by that rule alone, since only DNS knows where it points.

  `internal_names_local: true` additionally treats a host that is shaped like an
  internal name as local, for the https rule only: a single label (a Docker
  service name such as `nextcloud`) or a name under `.local`, `.lan`,
  `.internal` or `.home.arpa`. Callers pass it only when the operator has opted
  into private addresses for that integration domain. The decision is made
  from the name's shape and never by resolving it: DNS can answer differently
  between validation and use, and the SSRF guard already pins resolution for
  each request. `block_private_ips` is unaffected, so no name ever counts as
  private for that check.

  The shape is only a claim about where a name points: a single label can be
  completed to a public name by a resolver search domain, and `.lan` is not
  reserved. `http_to_internal_name?/1` tells the SSRF guard which requests
  passed on that claim, so it can confirm at request time that the address it
  connects to really is private before any credentials are sent.
