defmodule Tymeslot.Security.ConnectionPinning do
  @moduledoc """
  Turns an SSRF-approved address into the request options that make the
  approval binding.

  Every SSRF verdict this application makes is about a *hostname*, resolved
  once by `Tymeslot.Security.DnsResolution`. Handing the URL string on to
  Req/Finch then resolves that same hostname a second time, independently, when
  the socket opens. Between the two answers a record with a short TTL can move
  from a public address to `127.0.0.1` or `169.254.169.254`: the classic
  DNS-rebinding bypass, which needs no redirect and which re-checking closer to
  the connect cannot close, because every resolve-then-connect design has the
  window.

  `pin/3` closes it by connecting to the address that was actually approved.
  The URL's host is replaced with that IP literal and `:hostname` is passed
  through to Mint, which uses it for TLS SNI, certificate verification and the
  `Host` header — so a virtual-hosted target behind a CDN still routes, and a
  certificate is still checked against the name the user typed rather than
  against an IP.

  ## When pinning does not apply

  `pin/3` returns `:unpinned` rather than guessing, in four cases:

    * **No approved addresses.** Nothing was resolved to pin to — the caller
      validated by syntax alone (non-production, or an operator opt-out), so
      there is no verdict to make binding.
    * **The host is already an IP literal.** There is no name to rebind.
    * **A proxy applies to this request.** The socket opens to the proxy, and
      the proxy resolves the destination itself; rewriting the host would only
      change what we ask the proxy for.
    * **A `Req` test plug is configured.** No socket is opened at all.

  ## The proxy decision is made here, once

  Whether a proxy applies is a question about the *original* hostname: an
  operator's `NO_PROXY` names `internal.example.com` or `*.example.com`, never
  the address behind it. Pinning rewrites the host to an IP literal, so a
  second evaluation further down would ask that question of a string no bypass
  list can match, and a request the operator excluded from the proxy would go
  through it after all.

  So the decision is taken here and travels with the request: a pinned request
  carries `bypass_proxy: true`, which is not an instruction to skip a proxy
  that applies but the recorded verdict that none does — pinning happens only
  when none does. `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.HTTPClient` honours it rather than
  re-deriving anything from the rewritten URL. An unpinned request keeps its
  original hostname, so the client's own evaluation of it is still correct.

  Applies `pin/3` to a request, returning the URL to call and the options to
  call it with.

  Convenience for the two call sites that already hold the caller's option
  list: an unpinnable request comes back unchanged, so neither has to branch.

  `:connect_options` is merged one level deeper than the rest. It is a keyword
  list several callers already populate for reasons of their own — the
  Exchange client's `verify: :verify_none` for the self-signed certificates
  on-premises deployments carry, the custom video provider's connect timeout —
  and a flat merge would replace the caller's list with the pin's lone
  `:hostname`, silently reinstating certificate verification the operator
  turned off and dropping timeouts the caller budgeted for. The pin's own keys
  still win a collision: they are what makes the SSRF verdict binding.
