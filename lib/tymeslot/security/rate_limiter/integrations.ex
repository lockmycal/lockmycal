  Who a connection test is charged to.

  Always `{:user, user_id}` — the user who clicked "Test connection" or is
  setting up an integration. Never one instance-wide bucket: the actor is
  always required, a caller with no actor context is a bug at the call site,
  not a case to fall back to a shared bucket for. A scheduled background
  health probe never reaches this function at all — it is unmetered by
  construction, see `Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.ConnectionProbe`'s
  `:background` clause — so there is no competing "integration" actor here.

  The connection-test bucket a provider draws its budget from. `:discovery`

  One bucket meters several actions: the `:custom` bucket is drawn on by the
  "Test connection" button *and* by saving a self-hosted server's address, and
  an organiser who pressed "Add" never knowingly ran a connection test. The
  caller says which action it is, so the refusal can name the thing they did
