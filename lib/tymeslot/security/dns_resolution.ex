  meant to be on a private network: returns every address the hostname
  resolves to when all of them are private, loopback or link-local, and an

  Optional: a resolver that does not implement it cannot confirm that a name
  is internal, so the requests that depend on the confirmation are refused.

  DNS-resolving SSRF protection for server-side HTTP requests.

  Resolves a URL's hostname via `:inet.getaddrs/2` (plural) for both IPv4 and
  IPv6, and rejects the URL if **any** of the returned addresses falls within a
  private, loopback, link-local, or unspecified range.  Using the plural form
  closes the multi-record variant of DNS-based SSRF: an attacker cannot hide a
  private address behind a round-robin set that includes a public address.

  `resolve_public/2` returns the approved addresses so a caller can connect to
  one of them directly rather than letting Finch resolve the hostname a second
  time. That second resolution is the DNS-rebinding window: a short-TTL record
  can answer public here and loopback by the time the socket opens.
  `Tymeslot.Security.ConnectionPinning` turns those addresses into the
  request options that close it.

  For string-based (non-resolving) private IP checks at changeset time,
  use `Tymeslot.Security.UrlValidation` with `block_private_ips: true`.
