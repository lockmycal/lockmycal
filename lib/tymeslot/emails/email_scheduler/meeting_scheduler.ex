  Schedules the pair of emails a held booking produces: the invitee's
  acknowledgement and the host's request to answer.

  Both legs are attempted by the same job, but neither gates the other —
  `BookingApprovalEmails.handle_booking_request_emails/1` always tries both
  and requeues a single-leg follow-up here for whichever one failed.
  `skip_attendee_ack: true` re-sends only the host's copy; `skip_host_request:
  true` re-sends only the invitee's. Either flag means the other leg already
  succeeded, so a whole-job Oban retry of the follow-up must not duplicate it.

  Restricted to `:incomplete` unique states minus `:executing`: a fast
  reschedule that calls this again for the same meeting must not be
  swallowed by the first pair's already-completed job, but a single-leg
  follow-up is inserted from *inside* the job that is still executing when
  it discovers one leg failed — matching `:executing` here would conflict
  the follow-up against the very job inserting it, and Oban would silently
  report that as a duplicate rather than creating the row.

  Schedules the single reminder sent to a host who has not yet answered.

  Fires at `send_at`, halfway through the approval window. Uniqueness is keyed
  on the meeting alone with a ten-year period and restricted to `:incomplete`
  states, so a reschedule that re-enters the gate cannot stack a second nudge
  on a still-pending one (the deletion in `cancel_approval_emails/1` is what
  allows a genuinely new one to be inserted at all), while a nudge that has
  already fired for an earlier request does not block a fresh one for a
  re-entered one — Oban's default unique scope matches completed jobs too,
  and this meeting may cycle through the approval gate more than once.
