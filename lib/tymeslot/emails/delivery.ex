  # where neither the breaker nor the retry policy sees it. Bounding each send
  # here, inside the breaker, turns a hung relay into an ordinary timeout;
  # `EmailWorker` sizes its budget from this deadline. It must stay above
  # `Tymeslot.Mailer.SMTPAdapter`'s 15-second session deadline, which is what
  # reports a relay that hung before any message data was sent as retryable.

  Delivers an email using the configured mailer, wrapped in a circuit breaker.

  Retries are delegated to Oban (a single retry authority) rather than retried
  here — re-sending the same message on a flaky transport is what produces
  duplicate emails. A client-side timeout is treated as delivered for the same
  reason (see `timeout_error?/1`).

  Returns `{:error, {:recipient_rejected, reason}}` when the provider rejects
  the address permanently; callers should give up rather than retry.
