defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.Branding do
  @moduledoc """
  Instance-level branding applied to outgoing transactional email.

  A self-hosted instance can replace the logo that heads every email, the
  name substituted into user-facing copy, and the brand accent. All three are
  admin-editable settings (see `Tymeslot.AppSettings`), written only through
  the admin UI, which requires an admin role.

  The footer attribution is deliberately not configurable here.

  ## Logo storage

  Logos are normalised to PNG before they reach this module — the admin UI
  rasterises whatever the admin picked, so an SVG or WebP source still lands
  as a PNG. The uploaded file is moved under `branding/` inside the
  configured `:upload_directory`, the same volume-backed location as avatars
  and theme backgrounds, so a logo survives a container rebuild.

  Only the path *relative to* the upload directory is stored. An absolute
  path would break the moment the deployment type changed the upload root,
  and it would put a filesystem path from user input into a column that later
  feeds `File.read/1`.

  Each stored file gets a random suffix. The admin preview is served from
  `/uploads`, and reusing one filename would leave browsers showing the
  previous logo from cache after a replacement.

  # WCAG 2.1 minimum for the button's white text: it renders at

  # meet the 14pt-bold/18pt-regular "large text" carve-out, so the normal-text

  # `deep` clears the same 4.5:1 floor against band text that

  # than Tymeslot's own default one. Reaching it moved `deep` from the

  # used for the band) to "#0d786c" at 5.03:1, so the default stage band and
