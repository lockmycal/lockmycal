defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.RecipientLocale do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves the locale an email renders in, and runs the render inside it.

  Emails are rendered outside any request. The Oban worker hands each send to a
  fresh `Task.Supervisor` process whose Gettext locale is unset, so `dgettext/2`
  resolves against `default_locale/0` no matter who the recipient is. An email
  that does not establish a locale is therefore not "locale-agnostic" — it is
  silently English. Every user-facing email must wrap its rendering (subject
  included) in one of the functions here.

  The locale belongs to the **recipient**, never to whoever triggered the send.
  An admin changing a user's address, or a webhook cancelling a booking, must
  still produce mail in the reader's language.

  Booking mail to the attendee resolves its locale from the meeting
  (`attendee_locale`) and is wrapped by `Tymeslot.Emails.AppointmentBuilder`.
  Everything addressed to a registered user — account, auth and calendar mail,
  and the organiser's copy of booking mail — uses `users.locale`, through this
  module.

  `users.locale` is nullable, and NULL means "no explicit choice" — the web layer
  reads such a user's locale from their browser, which an email has no access to.
  A NULL therefore resolves to the default locale rather than raising.
