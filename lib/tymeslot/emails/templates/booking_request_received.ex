defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.Templates.BookingRequestReceived do
  @moduledoc """
  Tells an invitee their booking request has arrived and is not yet confirmed.

  This is the first of two emails on a meeting type requiring the host's
  approval; the second is the ordinary `AppointmentConfirmation`, sent once
  they say yes. The split is the whole point of the feature, so the wording
  here has to be unambiguous: the time is held, nobody has agreed to it yet,
  and here is when they will know.

  A booking that was confirmed before and is back in the gate because the
  invitee moved it (it has a `first_announced_at`) gets the reschedule
  wording instead, with `opts[:previous_start_time]` shown when the caller
  knows it.

  Deliberately carries **no `.ics` attachment**. A calendar file is a promise
  the host has not made, and an invitee whose calendar already shows the
  meeting will not read the email that follows.
