defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.Shared.MeetingComponents do
  @moduledoc """
  Public façade for the meeting-related email components — 2026 redesign.

  Each concern lives in a focused sibling module under
  `Tymeslot.Emails.Shared.Meeting.*`; this module re-exports them so callers
  have a single entry point for everything that renders a meeting inside an
  email.

  Sub-modules:

  - `Meeting.Hero` — the typographic hero block (`meeting_details_table/2`).
  - `Meeting.VideoSection` — the ticket-stub join CTA (`video_meeting_section/3`)
    and the reminder pill (`time_alert_badge/3`).
  - `Meeting.ActionsBar` — the reschedule / cancel link row
    (`meeting_actions_bar/2`).
  - `Meeting.Attendee` — the organiser-facing attendee table
    (`attendee_info_section/2`) and the attendee-message callout
    (`attendee_message_box/2`).
  - `Meeting.CustomAnswers` — the snapshotted custom-field answers table
    (`custom_answers_section/1`).
