defmodule Tymeslot.Emails.Shared.BookingRequestLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Classifies a meeting's location for display.

  Originally written for the three booking-approval templates
  (`BookingApprovalRequest`, `BookingRequestOutcome`, `BookingRequestReceived`),
  which render straight from `Meeting.t()` rather than a pre-built
  appointment-details payload. `AppointmentBuilder.from_meeting/2` and
  `Templates.RescheduleRequest` delegate to this instead of keeping their own
  copies, so this is now the one definition of "what kind of location is
  this" across the email tree.
