  Background-job context: the entry point for everything callers need to know
  about Oban's job table.

  Workers schedule their own jobs through `Oban` directly; what this context
  covers is the other direction, reading and repairing the queue. Maintenance
  workers ask it whether a run of their own is already pending, the reminder
  pipeline asks it to retire jobs whose meeting moved, and the queue monitor
  asks it what has accumulated or got stuck.

  Callers outside `Tymeslot.Jobs` use this module rather than
  `Tymeslot.Jobs.ObanJobQueries`, which is the data-access layer behind it.

  Returns the args currently stored on a job's row, or `nil` when no row exists.

  A worker whose uniqueness covers `:executing` with `replace: [:args]` can have
  its row's args rewritten by a conflicting insert while it runs; the running
  process only ever sees the args it started with. Rereading the row is how such
  a worker notices the replacement before it finishes.
