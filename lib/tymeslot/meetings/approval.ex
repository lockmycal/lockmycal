defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval do
  @moduledoc """
  The manual-approval gate: bookings a host holds before agreeing to them.

  A meeting type with `requires_approval` set does not confirm its bookings on
  submission. The meeting is inserted as `"awaiting_approval"`, which occupies
  its slot exactly as a confirmed booking does, and waits for the host to
  answer. Four things can end that wait, and this module owns all four.

  ## Why the transitions live in one module

  Every exit from the gate races every other one. The host can approve in the
  dashboard while the expiry job is firing; they can click Approve twice; a
  colleague can decline from a forwarded email after the host already accepted;
  the invitee can withdraw the request mid-decision. A read-then-write would
  let the second writer overwrite the first, and the failure is not cosmetic —
  it produces a confirmed meeting the host declined, or a released slot the
  host accepted.

  So the status change is a single guarded `UPDATE ... WHERE status =
  'awaiting_approval'` (`MeetingQueries.transition_from_awaiting_approval/2`).
  Every exit from the gate goes through it — including the invitee's own
  withdrawal and an external actor (the host deleting the tentative hold from
  their own calendar), both reached through `Bookings.Cancel`, which
  delegates back into `withdraw/2` rather than writing the status itself — so
  exactly one caller wins; the rest get `{:error, :not_awaiting_approval}`,
  which surfaces as "this request was already answered" rather than as a
  failure.

  ## What each exit means

    * `approve/1` — the host agrees. The meeting becomes `"confirmed"` and
      joins the ordinary booking pipeline through `Bookings.Activation`: the
      same video room, the same confirmation emails, the same reminders and
      webhooks an ungated booking would have produced. The invitee's second
      email is deliberately the standard confirmation, so it looks like every
      other Tymeslot booking. Answering after the request's own
      `approval_deadline_at` does not confirm it — see "The deadline" below.

    * `decline/2` — the host says no. The meeting becomes `"cancelled"`, which
      is not a compromise but the accurate status: the slot is released, the
      tentative calendar event removed, and the attendee told. A booking that
      was paid for but never approved gave the attendee nothing, so `release/3`
      refunds the full remaining balance itself rather than deferring to the
      cancellation pipeline, which exists for a meeting the attendee actually
      got to have and offers the host no such choice here — unless the request
      already *was* such a meeting before it re-entered the gate (see
      `refund_unapproved_request/1`). What distinguishes a decline from every
      other cancelled meeting is `approval_declined_at`, which only this path
      stamps; ask `declined?/1` rather than reading it directly.

    * `expire/1` — nobody answered in time. Identical to a decline apart from
      the status (`"expired"`) and the wording the invitee receives: the host
      did not refuse, the window simply lapsed. Silence never means yes.

    * `withdraw/2` — the invitee changes their mind, or the host deletes the
      tentative hold from their own calendar and `Bookings.Cancel` treats
      that as a withdrawal on their behalf. Mechanically identical to
      `decline/2` and `expire/1` — same guard, same refund rule, same video
      and calendar release — but distinct in meaning: nobody refused the
      request and nobody ran out the clock, so neither
      `approval_resolved_at` nor `approval_declined_at` is set, and the
      invitee gets `Bookings.Cancel`'s ordinary cancellation email rather
      than a decline or expiry notice.

  ## The deadline

  `deadline_for/2` is capped at the meeting's own start time. A request for a
  meeting in six hours cannot have a twenty-four hour window; it lapses when
  the meeting would have begun, because approving a booking whose slot has
  already passed helps nobody. `approve/1` enforces that deadline itself
  rather than trusting that the expiry sweep gets there first: a host
  answering after the window the invitee was promised gets the same outcome
  the sweep would have produced (the request is released as `"expired"`),
  not a late confirmation.

  Runs everything a booking newly confirmed out of the approval gate needs.

  `approve/1` calls this once it has won the guarded transition. It is public
  because approval is not the only way a held request becomes a confirmed
  booking: `Tymeslot.Bookings.Reschedule` confirms one outright when its
  meeting type stopped requiring approval while the request was still held,
  and that booking needs precisely the same treatment. There is no host answer
  to guard there — there is no gate left to answer — but the resulting meeting
  is indistinguishable from an approved one, and it has never been announced
  to anybody: without this it would have no confirmation email, no ICS, no
  video room, no reminders and no `meeting.created` webhook, while the request
  emails' nudge and expiry jobs stayed armed against a booking that is no
  longer held.

  Three steps, in this order: stop the request notifications, flip the
  tentative calendar hold to a real event, then hand the meeting to
  `Bookings.Activation`, which creates the video room before composing the
  confirmation so the join link is in the invitee's first email rather than a
  later correction. A booking confirmed before a reschedule sent it back into
  the gate is announced as rescheduled instead, to the invitee and to every
  integration (`Orchestrator.send_reapproval_notifications/1`,
  `Notifications.Events.meeting_created/1`).

  Each step is best-effort. The row is committed before this runs, so no
  failure here may turn a real confirmation into an error the caller has to
  explain; every step is separately retried or logged by its own module.

  Refunds in full a held request that ended without becoming a meeting —
  unless it was one already.

  A booking that was paid for but never approved gave the attendee nothing,
  so the full remaining balance goes back automatically: there is no
  confirmed meeting to weigh against a partial refund, and so no host-facing
  choice to offer (contrast `Meetings.Cancellation`, which cancels a meeting
  the attendee did get to have and lets the host choose none, partial, or
  full). That contrast breaks for a request that re-entered the gate: a
  reschedule of an already-`"confirmed"`, paid meeting resets it to
  `"awaiting_approval"` (`Bookings.Reschedule.reenters_gate?/1`), and if that
  re-request is then declined or expires, there genuinely *is* a confirmed
  meeting to weigh against a partial refund — the one the attendee already
  had, activated, and were told about. Auto-refunding it in full would make
  that choice for the host silently, so this checks `first_announced_at` and
  skips the automatic refund when it is set, leaving the payment refundable
  from the dashboard's payments screen instead. A payment row that was never
  actually paid is quietly skipped, since it has nothing to refund.

  It has to be `first_announced_at` and not `announced_at`: the re-gating
  reschedule clears `announced_at` on purpose, so that the host's second
  approval can claim the announcement fan-out for the new time
  (`Bookings.Reschedule`), and reading the claim here would therefore find it
  empty on exactly the meetings this rule is about.

  Public because this rule applies to every way a held request stops being
  held, not only the two this module resolves itself (`decline/2`,
  `expire/1`, via `after_release/1`): `withdraw/2` reaches it too, for an
  invitee's own withdrawal and for an externally-deleted hold. A failed
  refund is logged and never fails the caller's transition, which is already
