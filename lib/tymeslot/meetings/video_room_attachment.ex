  Attaches a video room the provider has already created to its meeting.

  The last step of `Tymeslot.Meetings.VideoRooms.add_video_room_to_meeting/1`,
  and the only one inside a database transaction: the provider call happens
  before it, so a slow provider never holds a connection. The meeting row is
  re-locked and re-checked here, so a concurrent worker that attached a room
  first wins and this one's room is discarded, and a room created for a
  location the meeting has since left is released instead of attached.

  # The room was created for the integration `meeting` named when it was read,
  # before the provider call. A reschedule can move the meeting to another
  # location while that call is in flight, and attaching the room anyway would
  # hand an in-person meeting a join link. So the integration is re-checked
  # under the lock too, and a room created for a location the meeting has left
  # is released rather than attached.
  #
  # A Teams meeting placed on the booking's own calendar event (see
  # `Tymeslot.Integrations.MeetingProvisioning.teams_room_placement/1`) is
  # that event, so its room id is the event id the meeting was read with. The
  # calendar queue can replace that event meanwhile
  # (`Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventSync.replace/3`), and the room would then
  # be recorded on an event that is gone. So the event is re-checked under the
  # lock as well, and a room placed on an event the meeting has left is not
  # attached: the job waits and places it again on the event the meeting now
  # has. The online meeting goes with the event it was put on.
