defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.ApprovalJobs do
  @moduledoc """
  The background job a held booking request's expiry owns, and its removal.

  This module owns one job: the per-meeting expiry scheduled at
  `approval_deadline_at`. The nudge is a separate job owned by
  `Tymeslot.Emails.EmailScheduler.MeetingScheduler`; the two are cancelled
  together, but by `Tymeslot.Notifications.Orchestrator.cancel_request_notifications/1`,
  not by this module — `cancel/1` here removes only the expiry.

  Cancellation is best-effort by design. Deleting a job that has already
  started executing is impossible, which is why the job does not trust the
  deletion: it re-reads the meeting and checks it is still held before
  acting, and `Approval`'s guarded transition refuses it if it is not.

  @doc """
  Schedules the job that releases this request when its deadline passes.

  A request with no deadline recorded gets no expiry job; it is then held
  until a host answers, which is the honest reading of "no deadline". A
  deadline already in the past is inserted as-is: Oban's stager promotes any
  `scheduled` job whose `scheduled_at` has passed on its next tick, so it
  still runs promptly rather than being treated as overdue.

  Deletes any expiry already scheduled for this meeting first. A request that
  re-enters the gate (e.g. an invitee reschedules a held request, which
  raises a new deadline for it) must not lose its insert to Oban's own
  uniqueness constraint on the *old* job: `unique` on `ApprovalExpiryWorker`
  keys on `meeting_id` alone, so without this the old deadline would win
  silently and release the slot early.
