  @moduledoc """
  Single owner of predicates derived from a meeting's two independent state
  axes: `status` (the booking lifecycle — pending, awaiting_payment,
  awaiting_approval, confirmed, cancelled, completed) and
  `reschedule_requested_at` (whether the organizer is currently awaiting the
  attendee to pick a new time). The two axes are orthogonal: an organizer
  reschedule request no longer overwrites `status`, so a `pending` or
  `awaiting_payment` meeting keeps that status while a request is pending.

  `status == "reschedule_requested"` is a legacy value: no code writes it any
  more, but it remains a valid enum member so historical (or unmigrated) rows
  keep reading correctly here.

  still hold", and this is "should we expect a provider event on the
  organizer's calendar right now". A meeting can be active yet have a void
  slot (an organizer reschedule request pending, or the legacy
  `"reschedule_requested"` status) — in that case we deliberately deleted or
  never created the provider event, so its absence must never be treated as
  an external deletion.

  deciding whether a missing event implies an external deletion) must use
