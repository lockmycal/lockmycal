defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventLink do
  @moduledoc """
  The single expression of "this cached provider event is that meeting".

  A booking written back to a connected calendar comes back through sync as a
  cached provider event, so every consumer that shows both lists has to know
  which cached row mirrors which meeting: the grid drops the booking
  projection, the agenda drops the provider copy, and the sync's post-commit
  pass needs the meeting to reconcile an external time change against.

  The two sides do not agree on one identifier, because `provider_event_id`
  means different things per provider family:

  | Provider | `meetings` | `provider_calendar_events` |
  |---|---|---|
  | Google, Outlook | provider event id | provider event id |
  | CalDAV family | *unset* — the mapping lives in `uid` | the event's href |

  So a join on `provider_event_id` alone silently matches nothing for every
  CalDAV-family integration, and one on `uid` alone matches nothing for Google
  and Outlook (whose cached `uid` is the provider's own iCalUID, not the UID
  Tymeslot generated). The rule that holds for both: **two records describe the
  same event when they share any non-blank identifier.** Identifiers are
  compared within a single calendar integration, and the values are distinct
  enough across namespaces (hrefs, provider ids, `…@tymeslot.com` UIDs) that a
  cross-match cannot occur in practice.

  Callers reach this through the `Tymeslot.Meetings` context.

  The reverse of `linked?/2`, for the caller holding one meeting and a list of

  as free time, since its own event sits in the host's calendar and would
  otherwise block every move onto (or, through the buffer, next to) the time
  it already occupies.
