defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.Workers.ApprovalSweepWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Cron backstop that releases held bookings whose deadline has passed.

  `ApprovalExpiryWorker` handles the punctual case; this exists for the
  requests it never got to. Runs every 15 minutes, so the worst case for a
  request whose scheduled job was lost is a quarter-hour of extra hold rather
  than an indefinite one.

  One host's failure must not stop the sweep: a request that cannot be
  released is logged and counted, and the remaining requests are still
  processed. Each release is independently guarded, so a request answered
  mid-sweep is skipped rather than overwritten.

  `@batch_limit` bounds a single run. A backlog larger than the limit is
  worked through over successive runs, oldest deadline first, rather than
  loading an unbounded result set and holding the queue for it.
