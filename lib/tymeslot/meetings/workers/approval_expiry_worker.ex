defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.Workers.ApprovalExpiryWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Releases one held booking whose deadline has passed.

  Scheduled at `approval_deadline_at` when the request is raised, so the
  common case is punctual: the slot frees at the moment the window closes,
  not up to a sweep interval later.

  ## Why this is not the only expiry path

  A per-meeting scheduled job is a promise Oban cannot fully keep across a
  long wait. A window may be days wide, and in that time the job can be lost
  to a pruner misconfiguration, a failed insert nobody noticed, or a database
  restored from a backup taken before it was enqueued. Each of those leaves an
  invitee waiting on a request that will never resolve and a host's calendar
  holding a slot nobody can book.

  `ApprovalSweepWorker` is the backstop, and the two are safe to overlap:
  `Approval.expire/1` is a guarded transition, so whichever arrives second is
  told the request is no longer held and does nothing.

  Deliberately `max_attempts: 1`. A retry would fire minutes later against a
  request that is either already expired (nothing to do) or was answered in
  the interval (must not be touched), and the sweep covers the case where the
  single attempt genuinely failed.
