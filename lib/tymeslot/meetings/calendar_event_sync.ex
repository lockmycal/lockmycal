defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventSync do
  @moduledoc """
  Domain orchestration for synchronising meeting calendar events with the
  configured calendar provider (CalDAV, Google, Outlook).

  This module owns the *what* of calendar synchronisation — the create, update
  and delete flows, including:

  - the create→update fallback when a meeting already carries a provider mapping,
  - the update→create-on-404 recovery,
  - replacing an event an update cannot correct (`replace/3`),
  - persistence of the resulting provider UID / event-id mapping back onto the
    meeting (via `Tymeslot.Meetings.MeetingQueries`),
  - sending an error notification to the calendar owner and flagging
    `calendar_sync_status: "creation_failed"` on persistent create failures,
    so the dashboard keeps a durable trace even if the email is missed.

  Each entry point returns a tagged tuple that the calling Oban worker
  (`Tymeslot.Workers.CalendarEventWorker`) maps to a retry/error outcome:

    * `:ok`
    * `{:error, error_type}` — an error category the worker classifies for retry
    * `{:discard, reason}` — the operation can never succeed

  The worker owns the *when* (Oban dispatch, timeouts, backoff, retry
  classification); this module owns the *what*. Persistence always flows through
  the relevant query module — no raw `Repo.*` writes live here.

  Replaces the meeting's calendar event `event_id` with a new one written from
  the meeting as it now stands, then deletes the old one.

  For an event carrying something no update can take off it: a Microsoft
  Teams meeting attached to the booking's own Outlook event, which Graph keeps
  once `isOnlineMeeting` is set. A booking moved to another location would
  otherwise keep offering the Teams link from the organiser's calendar.

  The order is what keeps the booking alive. The new event is written and its
  id persisted before the old one is deleted, so by the time inbound sync
  hears of the deletion nothing links the old event to the meeting any more,
  and it is not read as the booking having been deleted externally
  (`Tymeslot.Meetings.ExternalCalendarChanges`). A retry after the new event
  was recorded finds the meeting no longer on `event_id` and only deletes it.

  Nothing is replaced when the meeting holds a room on `event_id` again (the
  booking moved back to Teams before this ran), which is an ordinary update,
  or when it no longer expects a calendar event, whose own delete job removes
  the event. Both are checked again under the meeting's row lock before the
  new event is recorded, since a room can be attached to `event_id` while the
  new event is being written; the new event is then deleted again.
