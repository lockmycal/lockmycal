defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.ExternalCalendarChanges do
  @moduledoc """
  Applies externally detected calendar changes to the meeting lifecycle.

  When a calendar sync worker detects that a provider event linked to a
  Tymeslot meeting was deleted or modified externally, the Calendar context
  delegates here (via `Tymeslot.Meetings.apply_external_calendar_change/4`).
  This module owns the meeting-side consequences: updating the
  `calendar_sync_status`, auto-cancelling the meeting on external deletion
  (with status revert if cancellation fails, so the next sync retries the
  whole operation), notifying the host about external modifications, and
  clearing that flag again once the two sides agree.

  Detection of changes stays in the Calendar context — this module never
  talks to calendar providers or the event cache.

  Clears a previously recorded external modification, now that the provider
  event agrees with the meeting again.

  The counterpart of the `:modified` signal, and the reason the flag is not
  one-way. Detection is stateless — a sync pass compares one event against one
  meeting and has no memory of what an earlier pass flagged — so nothing else
  in the system ever takes `"externally_modified"` back off a meeting. A
  divergence that resolved itself (the host put the time back, or our own
  write to the provider finally landed) would otherwise leave the host with a
  permanent badge and a notification that was never withdrawn.

  Deliberately narrow: `"externally_deleted"` is left alone. That signal
  auto-cancels the meeting, and the status is the record of why it was
  cancelled, not a condition that can lapse.

  The fallback runs when the first lookup *misses*, not merely when the ID is
  absent: a CalDAV event carries an href in `provider_event_id`, while the
  meeting it mirrors carries no provider event ID at all and is only reachable
  by UID. Falling back on `nil` alone left those meetings unfindable whenever
  the caller had an href to offer. See `Tymeslot.Meetings.CalendarEventLink`
