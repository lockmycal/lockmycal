  Moves a meeting out of `"awaiting_approval"`, atomically.

  The guard is in the `WHERE` clause rather than read-then-write, because
  every exit from the approval gate races every other one: the host can
  approve in the dashboard while the expiry job fires, or click Approve twice,
  or decline from an email link a colleague already actioned. A changeset
  update would let the second writer silently overwrite the first, producing a
  confirmed meeting the host declined.

  Exactly one caller wins and receives the updated meeting; every other gets
  `{:error, :not_awaiting_approval}` and can say "already answered" rather
  than acting twice. `Tymeslot.Meetings.Approval` is the only intended caller.

  Bypasses the changeset deliberately — `update_all` takes plain columns — so
  `updated_at` is set here rather than by `timestamps/1`. Because there is no
  changeset, a violation of `unique_confirmed_meeting_per_organizer_at_time`
  (the guarantee that at most one confirmed-or-held meeting occupies an
  organizer's slot — widened to cover held requests by
  `20260902120100_add_unique_index_to_held_meetings.exs`) has no
  `unique_constraint/3` to translate it, so it is caught here directly and
  turned into `{:error, :slot_taken}` rather than letting the raw
