defmodule Tymeslot.Utils.DateTimeUtils.TimeFormat do
  @moduledoc """
  The single source of truth for whether a clock time renders as "2:30 PM" or
  "14:30", and for which languages expect which.

  ## How the format is decided

  Locale supplies the preset and an explicit choice supersedes it, so
  `resolve/2` is the entry point for every organiser-facing caller:

      TimeFormat.resolve(preferences.time_format, locale)

  A `nil` stored value means the organiser has never touched the setting, so
  their language decides: English gets a 12-hour clock, German, French, Italian,
  Ukrainian and Czech get a 24-hour one. Once they pick a format in settings,
  that value is stored and wins regardless of language.

  ## Audience

  This governs **organiser-facing** output only: the dashboard, the availability
  grid, and the emails addressed to the organiser. Attendees never saw this
  setting and often read in a different language from the organiser, so
  attendee-facing output is formatted from the attendee's own locale via
  `TymeslotWeb.Helpers.LocaleFormat.format_time/2`. The rule: **an explicit
  preference formats the person who set it, locale convention formats everyone
  else.**

  The clock format a language implies, used when the organiser has not chosen
  one. This is the table `LocaleFormat.format_time/2` renders from, so an
  attendee reading German and an organiser who left the setting alone agree.

  @doc """
  Resolves the clock format to render in: the organiser's stored choice when
  they have made one, otherwise the preset their language implies.

  An unrecognised stored value is treated as no choice rather than as an error,
  so a hand-edited database row degrades to the locale preset instead of
  crashing a dashboard render.
