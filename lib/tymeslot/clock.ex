defmodule Tymeslot.Clock do
  @moduledoc """
  Injectable source of "now".

  Time-dependent logic — booking cut-offs, availability windows, expiry checks —
  reads the current time through this module instead of calling
  `DateTime.utc_now/0` directly. That lets tests pin "now" to a fixed instant and
  exercise boundaries (a minute before a cut-off, a DST transition, the stroke of
  midnight) deterministically, rather than racing the wall clock.

  In production `utc_now/0` is exactly `DateTime.utc_now/0`. Tests freeze it with
  `Tymeslot.Test.ClockHelpers` — the override is stored in the calling process's
  dictionary, so it is test-local and safe under `async: true` for any code that
  runs in the test process.

  That includes Oban workers as this suite tests them: `Oban.Testing.perform_job/2`
  and `Oban.drain_queue/1` both run `perform/1` in the calling process, so a job
  sees a clock the test froze. What does defeat a freeze is a genuinely spawned
  process: `Task.Supervisor.async`, which a few workers use as a timeout guard,
  or a job picked up by a live queue. Freeze those flows at the plain module the
  spawned code calls into rather than at the worker.

  Adoption is incremental: a namespace is "clock-managed" once all of its
  `utc_now`/`utc_today` reads go through here, at which point
  `CredoChecks.ClockUsage` guards it against regressions.
