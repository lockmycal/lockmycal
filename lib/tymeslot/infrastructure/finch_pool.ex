defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.FinchPool do
  @moduledoc """
  Keeps every outbound request on the application's own Finch instance, even
  when it needs connection options of its own.

  `Tymeslot.Finch` is started once, in `Tymeslot.Application`, with a pool
  configuration a deployment can size for itself. Req will only use a named
  instance when the request carries no `:connect_options`: hand it any, and it
  hashes them into a name, starts *another whole Finch instance* under its own
  supervisor for that name, and keeps it for the lifetime of the node. Since
  the connection pinning that SSRF protection depends on passes the target's
  hostname as a connect option, and that hostname differs per destination, the
  practical effect was one permanent Finch instance, plus one never-collected
  atom, per hostname the application had ever talked to. Webhook destinations
  are user-supplied, so nothing bounded that.

  Those instances also ran on Finch's stock defaults rather than ours, quietly
  dropping the `conn_max_idle_time` that exists to evict connections a remote
  closed behind our back, and the pool size a larger deployment configures.

  Finch can express the same thing without any of that: a *tagged pool* on the
  instance that is already running. `request_option/2` registers one keyed by
  the connection options it needs and returns the Req option that selects it,
  so the caller passes `:finch` alone and never `:connect_options`.

  @doc """
  The pool configuration `Tymeslot.Finch` itself starts with.

  `size`/`count` are read from config so a deployment with more headroom can
  run a larger pool than a small self-hosted box; the values below are the
  safe defaults and are overridden via `config :tymeslot, :finch_default_pool`.

  `conn_max_idle_time` (NOT `pool_max_idle_time`) evicts individual
  connections the remote silently closed after its keep-alive timeout,
  preventing "socket closed" errors. `pool_max_idle_time` would instead tear
  the whole pool down when idle and churn pool restarts, surfacing as
  transient `:pool_not_available` errors when traffic resumes, so it is left
  at its `:infinity` default. The transport timeout caps the TCP connect
  handshake at 10s, so an unreachable endpoint fails there rather than at the
  OS-level TCP timeout of 75-120s.

  Returns the Req `:finch` option to reach `url` with `connect_options`.

  With no connection options the shared pool serves the request as it always
  did. With some, a pool carrying them is registered on the same instance
  under a tag derived from those options, so that two requests wanting the
  same connection settings to the same destination share one pool and two
  wanting different ones do not collide.

  `:error` means there is no Finch instance to register against — the test
  suite routes Req through a plug instead — and the caller should fall back to
  passing the connection options through to Req.
