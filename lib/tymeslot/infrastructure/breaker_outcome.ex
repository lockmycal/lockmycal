defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.BreakerOutcome do
  @moduledoc """
  Decides what a call's result says about the *provider's* health.

  A circuit breaker exists to stop hammering a service that is down. That makes
  the only question it needs answered "is the remote side unwell?", which is a
  narrower question than "did this call fail?". A rejected OAuth grant, a
  missing scope, a 404, a changeset error: all of these are failures, and none
  of them is evidence that the provider is unavailable. Counting them as
  outages opens a breaker that is shared by every tenant, so one user's bad
  credentials stop everyone else's calls.

  Hence three outcomes rather than two:

  - `:failure` - the provider looks unwell (transport errors, 5xx, 429, and
    anything a caller explicitly tags `{:provider_error, reason}`).
  - `:success` - the call worked.
  - `:ignore` - the call failed, but for a reason local to us or specific to
    this tenant's data. Breaker state is left completely untouched: it neither
    trips nor counts towards closing a half-open breaker.

  The `{:provider_error, reason}` tag is the deliberate escape hatch, and the
  video providers already use it: `ZoomProvider.classify_token_result/1` hands
  back a plain `{:error, _}` for a rejected grant and `{:provider_error, _}`
  for "anything else, for the breaker to witness". This module is where that
  convention is decided once, so a new provider inherits it instead of growing
  another copy.

  @type outcome :: :success | :failure | :ignore

  # OAuth error markers that mean the credential itself is gone — a rejected
  # or expired grant, not the provider being unwell. Shared by every OAuth
  # video provider (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet) and by
  # `HealthCheck.ResponseHandler`'s reauth fast-path, which previously each
  # carried their own copy; the provider copies only matched strings, so a
  # bare atom reason (`:unauthorized`, `:invalid_credentials`,
  # `:token_expired`) fell through to `{:provider_error, _}` and tripped the
  # shared breaker instead of being recognised as the tenant's problem.
  #
  # String markers are matched against whole-word tokens extracted from the
  # lowercased error reason (split on non-alphanumeric/underscore
  # boundaries), which prevents `"invalid_grant"` from matching extended
  # forms such as `"invalid_grant_period_started"` and prevents
  # `"unauthorized"` false positives from strings like `"unauthorized
  # origin"` produced by CalDAV servers and Google JS-API errors — which is
  # also why the string list omits `"unauthorized"`: the atom form already
  # covers it without that risk.

  Whether `reason` describes a permanently rejected credential (an expired or
  revoked OAuth grant) rather than a provider outage.

  A caller that gets `true` back should surface this as a plain `{:error, _}`
  that bypasses the breaker entirely; the tenant needs to reconnect, and
  retrying or counting it against a shared breaker helps no one.
