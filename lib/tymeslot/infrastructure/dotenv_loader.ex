  @moduledoc """
  Populates the system environment from a `.env` file as a fallback for
  shell-supplied variables.

  Shell environment variables always win — values from `.env` are only
  applied to keys that are not already set. This lets operators configure
  releases by dropping a flat `.env` at the release root while still
  allowing one-off shell overrides.

  Invoked at the top of `config/runtime.exs` so the rest of runtime
  configuration sees a populated environment via `System.get_env/1`.

  ## The grammar

  In both container images the same file is read twice: the entrypoint
  (`start.sh` on Cloudron, `start-docker.sh` on Docker) applies it with
  `scripts/dotenv-reader.sh` before the release boots, and this module
  applies it again from `config/runtime.exs` (and in every eval session).
  A value the two read differently is a value an operator cannot reason
  about, so the parser below implements exactly the grammar that shell
  reader accepts, and nothing else. The shell reader is the specification;
  `DotenvLoaderTest` runs both over one fixture and compares.

    * A line is stripped of a trailing `\\r`, then of leading whitespace.
      Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.
    * One leading `export ` is dropped.
    * The key is everything before the first `=`, trailing whitespace
      removed, and must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.
    * The value is everything after the first `=`, read in one of three
      ways depending on its first non-whitespace character:
      * `'single quoted'` is literal, character for character, up to the
        next `'`. There is no escape for a single quote.
      * `"double quoted"` runs to the first unescaped `"`, resolving
        `\\n \\r \\t \\f \\b`, `\\uXXXX`, and a backslash before any other
        character as that bare character.
      * Anything else is literal up to the first whitespace-preceded `#`,
        with leading and trailing whitespace removed. The `#` test runs
        before the leading whitespace comes off, so `KEY= # note` is empty.
    * After a closing quote only whitespace and a `#` comment may follow;
      any other text rejects the line. That is also how a quote inside a
      value shows up: `'it's'` closes early and leaves `s'` behind.
    * There is no interpolation and no command substitution: `${VAR}` and
      `$(cmd)` are ordinary text wherever they appear.
    * A value whose quote never closes (a multi-line value) is rejected
      rather than guessed at, matching the shell reader, which is
      line-oriented and cannot do otherwise.
    * A key repeated in one file takes its last value.

  The one place agreement stops is application, not parsing. A `\\uXXXX`
  escape naming a surrogate encodes to the same bytes here as in the
  shell, but those bytes are not valid UTF-8, so `apply_var/2` skips the
  key rather than let `System.put_env/2` raise during boot.

  Loads each `.env` path in order and applies any keys that are not yet
  set in the system environment.

  Missing files are silently skipped — boot must never fail because an
  optional `.env` is absent. Lines that do not parse log a warning naming
  their line numbers and are skipped individually; one bad line never
  costs the file its other values.
