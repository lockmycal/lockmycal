defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.CrashReporter do
  @moduledoc """
  Global `:logger` handler that records process crashes in ErrorTracker.

  ErrorTracker's integrations record exceptions raised in Phoenix requests,
  in the LiveView callbacks Phoenix instruments (mount, handle_params,
  handle_event, render) and in Oban jobs. Everything else (a GenServer, a
  supervised Task, a bare process, a LiveView's `handle_info/2`) is visible
  only as the crash report OTP logs when the process dies: an `:error` event
  carrying `crash_reason` metadata. This handler matches those events and
  passes them to `ErrorTracker.report/3`, which applies the same Ignorer and
  Filter as the integrations. Alerting on what is recorded is
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.Alerter`'s job, not this module's.

  ## Recording each crash once

  A crash an integration recorded is then logged by the dying process too: a
  LiveView event handler that raises is recorded by the LiveView integration
  and then terminates the LiveView's GenServer, which logs it. `attach/0`
  therefore also listens to ErrorTracker's `[:error_tracker, :occurrence,
  :new]` event and remembers, in the process that reported, what it recorded.
  The `:logger` handler runs in the process that crashed, so it can tell
  whether the crash it is looking at was recorded a moment earlier in the
  same process, and skip it.

  This assumes a report made in a process is an integration's, made just
  before the process crashes. A process that reports an exception it
  handled and then carries on would leave the memory behind, and a later
  crash with the same kind and message would be skipped. Such a direct
  report must therefore be made inside
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.with_direct_report/1`, whose
  occurrences are not remembered.

  Matching on the recorded crash rather than on which integration's context
  keys the process carries is deliberate: a LiveView process carries
  `"live_view.*"` context from mount onwards, but a crash in its
  `handle_info/2` is recorded by no integration.

  ## Safety

    * The handler callback does no database work. It filters and offloads
      the report to `ErrorTracking.task_supervisor/0`, so a slow or failing
      database can never block or kill the logging pipeline. That supervisor
      runs a bounded number of tasks, so a crash storm cannot become one
      concurrent database writer per crash: a crash arriving while every
      task is busy is dropped, and counted by the
      `[:tymeslot, :crash_reporter, :dropped]` telemetry event. The crashing process's
      ErrorTracker context is captured first and passed along, since the
      offloaded task has none of its own.
    * A failure inside the offloaded report is logged under this module's own
      domain, which the handler's filter drops, so it cannot re-enter the
      handler.
    * Nothing is done while ErrorTracker's `enabled` switch is off, read on
      every crash as ErrorTracker itself reads it.
    * Orderly exits are not recorded. A LiveView or LiveComponent sent an
      event name none of its `handle_event/3` clauses matches is logged as a
      warning instead, by the rule in
      `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.UnmatchedEvent`.
