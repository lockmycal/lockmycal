defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.ObanOutcomes do
  @moduledoc """
  Records the Oban jobs that end without running to completion and without
  raising, which ErrorTracker's own Oban integration never sees, and the jobs
  that fail, in that integration's place (see *Failed jobs* below).

  That integration listens to `[:oban, :job, :exception]` only: a job that
  raises, returns `{:error, reason}` or times out, including the final
  attempt that Oban then discards. Three other ways a job can end leave no
  trace there:

    * The worker returns `{:discard, reason}` or `{:cancel, reason}`. Oban
      reports that as `[:oban, :job, :stop]` with state `:discard` or
      `:cancelled`. This module records it through
      `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.report_error/3`, as a
      `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.JobDiscardedError`, unless the
      worker declares the outcome expected (below). Oban reports a job
      outcome as either `:stop` or `:exception`, never both, so no job
      outcome is recorded twice.
    * `Oban.Lifeline` discards an `executing` job that has used up its
      attempts, reported as `[:oban, :plugin, :stop]` with the jobs in
      `discarded_jobs`.
    * `Tymeslot.Workers.ObanMaintenanceWorker` moves a stuck job straight to
      `discarded`, which emits no telemetry at all; it calls
      `report_force_discarded/2` itself.

  The last two raise one `:oban_jobs_force_discarded` admin alert per sweep
  rather than an error each: no code failed, so there is no call site to
  group by, and the operator needs the count per worker and queue.

  ## Expected outcomes

  Most discards are a worker recognising that its work no longer applies (the
  meeting was deleted, the integration disconnected) or that only the user
  can fix it (credentials to reconnect, a webhook endpoint refusing
  deliveries). A worker says so by implementing
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ExpectedJobOutcome`, next to the code that
  returns the reason. The job's worker is resolved from its name without
  creating atoms; when it does not export `expected_outcome?/1`, or the
  callback raises or returns anything but `true`, the outcome is recorded.

  ## Grouping

  ErrorTracker groups occurrences by exception kind and source frame, and a
  discard has no stacktrace. The recorded frame is therefore synthetic: the
  worker's `perform/1`, with the outcome and the reason's leading text as its
  file and line 0. So each worker and reason is one error, while the detail
  after a reason's first `": "` (an HTTP status line, a provider message)
  stays in the message and does not split it.

  ## Failed jobs

  A job that raises, returns `{:error, reason}`, times out or is killed is
  reported as `[:oban, :job, :exception]`. ErrorTracker's integration records
  it with the `job.*` context its `:start` handler put in the job's process.
  A timeout or a crash of a linked process is reported from a fresh task
  under Oban's foreman instead, which has no such context: the occurrence
  would carry no job id, and an alert about a failing admin alert email
  could not be recognised as one. `report_exception/1` therefore builds the
  `job.*` context from the job itself and passes it with the report.
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.SafeIntegrations` calls it in place
  of the integration's own handler.

  ErrorTracker gives an `{:error, reason}` returned by a worker a synthetic
  frame, the worker's `perform/2`, so every returned error of one worker is
  one error, retryable or not. An alert is raised for a new error or a
  regression only, so once a worker had failed an attempt, a later job of it
  that failed for good raised nothing. A job's last failed attempt (state
  `:discard`) is therefore recorded here instead, as a `JobDiscardedError`
  with the outcome `:exhausted`, grouped, filtered through the worker's
  expected outcomes and masked exactly as a discard is. It is recorded once:
  not also as the failure itself. Its stacktrace is the synthetic frame,
  followed by the stacktrace of an exception the worker raised, so the
  error's source is the worker and the raise site is still stored.
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.Alerter` raises nothing for an
  attempt that can still be retried, so a job alerts when it is given up on,
  and a failure a retry recovers from alerts not at all.

  Telemetry detaches a handler that raises, so `handle_event/4` never raises:
  a failure is logged, naming only its module, and dropped.
