defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.ReasonScrubber do
  @moduledoc """
  Masks email addresses and credentials in the exception messages
  ErrorTracker stores.

  ErrorTracker runs the occurrence context through
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.Filter`, but stores the exception's
  message (the `reason` of the error and of each occurrence) exactly as the
  exception gave it, and many messages quote the term that failed. This
  handler listens to `[:error_tracker, :occurrence, :new]`, emitted once both
  rows are written, and rewrites either reason whose masked form differs:
  `PIIScrubber.mask_emails/1` for email addresses,
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.Logging.Redactor` for tokens and secrets.

  Rewriting the reason is safe for grouping: an error's fingerprint is its
  kind and source, never its reason.

  ErrorTracker offers no hook on the message before the insert, so this
  rewrite is the only guard for the reports its integrations make. Our own
  reports go further: `scrub_exception/1` redacts the exception before it is
  handed to `ErrorTracker.report/3`, so the message written first is already
  masked wherever it can be, and the rewrite here is the backstop.

  Telemetry detaches a handler that raises, which would leave every later
  message unmasked until the next restart, so `handle_event/4` never raises:
  a failure is logged, naming only its module, and dropped.

  `Ecto.InvalidChangesetError`) is then computed from redacted ones, so it

  Masks the stored reasons the telemetry handler should have masked but did

  The handler's rewrite is a second write after the insert, and nothing
  retries it should it fail, so an unmasked reason would otherwise be kept
  for as long as the row. Run daily over a window longer than a day, this
  bounds that to the next run. Errors and occurrences are both walked, since
  each occurrence stores its own reason and an error's is its first
  occurrence's.

  Reads a page at a time (`:batch_size`, default #{@rescrub_batch_size}) and
  writes only the rows whose reason changes, through the same conditional
  update the handler uses. How many occurrences an error has in the window
  is bounded by `ReportThrottle`'s budget and, once the daily trim has run,
  by its per-error cap.
