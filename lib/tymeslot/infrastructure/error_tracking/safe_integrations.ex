defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.SafeIntegrations do
  @moduledoc """
  Re-attaches ErrorTracker's Phoenix, LiveView and Oban integrations behind a
  handler that cannot raise.

  ErrorTracker attaches its integrations as telemetry handlers when its
  application starts. Their `:exception` handlers call `ErrorTracker.report/3`,
  which writes to the database without rescuing, and telemetry detaches a
  handler that raises, together with every event attached under the same
  handler id. One `DBConnection.ConnectionError` while the pool is exhausted
  would therefore stop every exception from being recorded, and the `:start`
  handlers that set the request, LiveView and job context with it, until the
  next restart.

  `install/0` detaches the library's handlers and attaches one per
  integration that calls the library's own `handle_event/4` inside
  `try`/`rescue`/`catch`. A failure is logged, naming only the integration and
  the failure's module or kind, and dropped. It is never reported to
  ErrorTracker, which is what just failed.

  A failed Oban job is the one event not passed to the library: it goes to
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ErrorTracking.ObanOutcomes.report_exception/1`,
  which records it with the job's context taken from the event, since Oban
  reports some failures from a process that never ran the job.

  The handler ids and events below are copied from
  `ErrorTracker.Integrations.Oban` and `ErrorTracker.Integrations.Phoenix`.
  The test suite attaches the library's own handlers and compares, so an
  upgrade that renames either fails there instead of leaving the unguarded
  handlers attached.
