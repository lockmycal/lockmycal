  # An index PostgreSQL will not plan against is `indisvalid = false`. The two
  # further flags are what separate "broken and will stay broken" from the
  # states that clear themselves:
  #
  #   * `indislive = false` is only ever the tail of a `DROP INDEX
  #     CONCURRENTLY`: the index is already invisible to the planner *and* to
  #     writers, and disappears when the drop finishes or is retried. Warning
  #     about an index somebody is deliberately removing is noise, so it is
  #     excluded.
  #
  #   * `indisready` is *not* used as a filter, and that is the finding worth
  #     recording: it does not separate a failed build from a running one. A
  #     concurrent build passes through `(indisready = false, indisvalid =
  #     false)` while it does its first table scan and `(indisready = true,
  #     indisvalid = false)` while it validates, and an interruption in either
  #     window leaves the index sitting in that same state forever. Filtering
  #     `indisready = false` out would have hidden the easiest case of all to
  #     hit: a unique build that dies on a duplicate during its first scan.
  #     What the flag does say is how much the leftover costs, since a
  #     `indisready = true` index is still maintained on every write while
  #     buying no reads, so it is reported as metadata instead.
  #
  # The one state that genuinely is transient, a build running right now on
  # this or another node, is excluded by `pg_stat_progress_create_index`
  # (PostgreSQL 12+; this project requires 14+), which carries exactly one row
  # per in-flight `CREATE INDEX` / `REINDEX` keyed by the index OID. That is
  # the purpose-built signal for "mid-build", where the catalogue flags are
  # ambiguous. Its one limitation is visibility: an unprivileged role sees only
  # its own backends' rows, so a build started by a *different* role could
  # still be reported. Tymeslot runs its migrations and its application under
  # one role, so that case does not arise here.
  #
  # `current_schemas(false)` keeps this to the schemas the application's own
  # search path resolves to, so `pg_catalog`, `pg_toast` and any unrelated
  # schema sharing the database are never reported.
