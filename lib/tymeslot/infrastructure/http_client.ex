  How long a single request sent with `method` and `options` may wait on its
  pool and the network, in milliseconds: checking a connection out of the pool,
  connecting, and waiting for the response, as `request/5` applies them.

  The connect timeout is the request's `connect_options: [timeout: ms]`, or the
  one the shared pool connects with (`Tymeslot.Infrastructure.FinchPool`).

  This is a hard bound only for a request that passes `request_timeout:`,
  which caps the whole response, and does not follow redirects (every request
  guarded by `ssrf_protect: true` refuses them). Without `request_timeout:` the
  receive timeout applies to each chunk of the body rather than to the
  response as a whole, and each redirect followed starts afresh, so a server
  trickling its answer can exceed it. Name resolution is never counted: the
  system resolver has no timeout of its own here.

  A caller that has to outlast a request, such as a job running it under a
  timeout of its own, derives that timeout from this rather than repeating the
  numbers, and passes `request_timeout:` when it needs the bound to hold.
