defmodule Tymeslot.Infrastructure.AdminAlerts.EmailNotifier do
  @moduledoc """
  Default implementation of `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.AdminAlerts`.

  Always logs the alert at the registry-defined severity. Additionally delivers
  it when **all** of the following are true:

    1. `:admin_alerts_enabled` is `true`
    2. `:admin_alert_email` is configured to a valid email address
    3. The alert is not about the email pipeline itself (see `self_referential?/2`)
    4. The Oban uniqueness constraint allows the job (i.e. an identical alert
       has not been enqueued within the last 24 hours)

  Warnings and errors are delivered as an admin alert email via
  `Tymeslot.Workers.EmailWorker` at once. Info alerts are recorded for the
  daily digest instead (`Tymeslot.Infrastructure.AdminAlerts.Digest`), where
  the same dedup key collapses repeats into one counted entry. New-error and
  regression alerts are emailed at once only up to a few an hour; the rest
  wait for one roll-up email (`Tymeslot.Infrastructure.AdminAlerts.ErrorBurst`).

  The headline, the logged metadata and the delivered metadata are all built from
  a `PIIScrubber`-scrubbed copy of the caller's metadata; only the dedup key is
  derived from the raw values, and it is persisted as a hash.

  Metadata is enriched with deployment context (`tymeslot_version`,
  `deployment_type`, `domain`, `hostname`, `timestamp`) before being passed to
  the template, so error reports include enough information to be actionable.
