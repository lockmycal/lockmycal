  Resolves a day's breaks into absolute instants on the owner's clock.

  Break times are stored as the owner's local wall-clock times with no date
  attached, so they mean nothing until anchored to a date and a zone. Both
  have to be the *owner's*: the window a slot grid is built from has already
  been shifted into the booker's zone, and resolving a break there puts the
  owner's lunch on the booker's clock, hiding the wrong hours by exactly the
  offset between them.

  `owner_date` must be the owner-frame date the breaks were read for
  (`window.date`), not the date of the window's start in the booker's zone.
  A window can straddle midnight in the booker's zone, which is why windows
  carry the date they came from; taking the date off the booker-side datetime
  reintroduces the same error one day out instead of one offset out.

  Resolving against a real date and zone, rather than applying a fixed offset,
  is also what keeps this correct across a DST boundary inside the window.

  Generates time slots for a date range, excluding break periods.

  ## Parameters
    - start_dt: Start datetime
    - end_dt: End datetime
    - duration_minutes: Meeting duration in minutes
    - selected_date: The date for slot generation
    - breaks: Break periods as absolute `{start, end}` instants, already
      resolved against the owner's date and zone by `resolve_breaks/3`.
      They must arrive resolved: `start_dt` here is in the *booker's* zone,
      so a break carried as a bare `Time` would be read on the booker's wall
      clock and land on the wrong hours whenever the two zones differ.
    - breaks: List of {start_time, end_time} tuples representing break periods
    - interval_minutes: Optional spacing between slot starts. Defaults to the
      meeting duration, which is the historical behaviour. A shorter interval
      offers overlapping starts; a longer one offers fewer, rounder starts.
      When set explicitly, the grid also anchors to a wall-clock boundary
      (e.g. 60 minutes lands on the hour) instead of wherever the window
      happens to start; a nil interval keeps the unanchored, duration-locked
      grid unchanged.
    - owner_timezone: The clock that anchoring reads. `start_dt` has already
      been shifted into the booker's timezone by the time it gets here, so
      the boundary has to be measured somewhere else: the interval is the
      owner's setting and means "this far apart, on my clock". Required
      whenever `interval_minutes` is set, ignored when it is nil.

  Returns a list of formatted time strings like "9:00 AM", excluding slots that
  would overlap with break periods.
