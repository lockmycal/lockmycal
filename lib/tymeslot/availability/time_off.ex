defmodule Tymeslot.Availability.TimeOff do
  @moduledoc """
  Time off: stretches during which a profile's owner takes no bookings,
  recorded here instead of as blocking events in a connected calendar.

  A period is one continuous interval in the owner's timezone, running from
  `starts_on` at `start_time` to `ends_on` at `end_time`, both dates
  inclusive, with a null time meaning the start or end of that day. Days
  strictly between the two ends are therefore always blocked in full, and the
  times only ever trim the first and last day — the shape "leaving Friday
  lunchtime, back Monday morning" needs, and the shape a whole-day holiday
  degenerates to when both times are null.

  `blocked_window/2` is the single reading of that model: everything else in
  the availability calculation asks this module what a date looks like rather
  than comparing dates and times itself.

  Periods are profile-wide by construction, so they outrank the per-schedule
  date overrides: a day covered in full by time off offers nothing, even where
  an override marked that same date `available`. "I am away" is a statement
  about the person and cannot be contradicted by one schedule's exception.

  The owner's live bookings that fall inside `period`, soonest first.

  A period only takes days out of *future* availability: bookings already in

  entering a holiday over a booking usually means to move that booking
  themselves; the point is that they are told, rather than left to find out.

  Accepts a changeset as well as a stored row, so the form can ask about the
  period as it will be: on an edit that is the submitted attrs merged onto the
  stored row, which is the shape most likely to swallow a booking. A period
  that is incomplete, or that the changeset has already rejected, names no
  interval to ask about and counts nothing.

  The interval is the one `busy_intervals/4` publishes, DST resolution
  included, rather than a comparison of the period's dates against stored UTC
  start times: the dates are wall-clock in the owner's timezone, so comparing
