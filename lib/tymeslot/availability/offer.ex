defmodule Tymeslot.Availability.Offer do
  @moduledoc """
  The times a public booking page offers.

  Answers the two questions the booking page asks: which times are free on one
  date (`slots_for_date/3`), and which days in a range have any free time at
  all (`days_in_range/4`). Both build their rules from `config/4`, which rests
  on `Tymeslot.Availability.Schedules.config/2`, the same rules the booking
  submit re-checks against (`Tymeslot.Bookings.Policy.scheduling_config/2`).
  A time offered here is therefore a time the submit accepts.

  Both questions are answered against the same busy set: the host's connected
  calendars, merged with the host's own live bookings. The bookings are what
  stop the two paths disagreeing, because the submit refuses from the meetings
  table and would otherwise reject a slot this module had just offered; see
  `Tymeslot.Meetings.BusyPeriods`.

  Works on a plain request map rather than a socket, so a fetch task can
  capture it whole and nothing here depends on the web layer.

  What a booking page is showing, and to whom.

    * `:profile` - the organiser's profile. Its `user_id` is whose calendar and
      bookings are read, so the organiser cannot be named separately from the
      profile and the two cannot disagree.
    * `:user_timezone` - the booker's timezone.
    * `:meeting_type` - the resolved meeting type, or nil before one is chosen.
    * `:reschedule_uid` - the meeting a reschedule page is moving, as the link
      named it. The meeting counts neither against the host's booking limits
      nor as a calendar conflict with itself, exactly as
      `Tymeslot.Bookings.Reschedule` leaves it out of both when the move is
      submitted, but only once it is proven to be a movable meeting of this
      organiser; any other value is ignored.
    * `:demo_mode?` - whether the page is running as a demo.
    * `:debug_calendar_module` - a calendar module override, for development.
