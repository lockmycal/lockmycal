  # identical alert enqueued a fresh job at once. When the alert jobs' own
  # failures raised further alerts, one email outage produced an unbounded
  # chain of alert jobs instead of a single deduplicated one. The Pruner's
  # `max_age` is a week in dev and production, comfortably longer than this

  # backoff doubling from a minute up to an hour span about 14 hours, and stay
  # inside the dedup window, so the job holds the slot for its whole life and
  # a repeat raised while it retries is still deduplicated. A rejected
  # recipient still discards at once and an open breaker still snoozes (a
  # snooze costs no attempt), exactly as for every other email.

  The hash is derived from the category plus the `:dedup_key` option when

  collapse within the dedup window instead of each hashing differently.
