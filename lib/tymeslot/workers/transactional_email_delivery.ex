defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.TransactionalEmailDelivery do
  @moduledoc """
  Delivers one email from an Oban worker that calls `Tymeslot.Emails.Delivery`
  directly, and turns the delivery result into that job's outcome.

  `handle_failure/3` is also the policy `Tymeslot.Workers.EmailWorker` calls
  for the same three delivery reasons, so a circuit-open provider, a rate
  limit, and a rejected recipient mean the same thing everywhere in the email
  pipeline rather than being decided twice.

  These workers sit outside `Tymeslot.Workers.EmailWorker`, so they inherit
  Oban's default backoff, which exhausts five attempts in roughly ninety
  seconds. The mail circuit breaker stays open for five minutes, so without
  this every attempt would be spent while the provider was known-unavailable
  and the email then discarded for good. Snoozing past the recovery window
  costs no attempt, so it is bounded here by `SnoozePolicy` instead.

  A permanently rejected recipient is discarded for the matching reason: no
  number of retries can reach a dead address, and exhausting the attempts
  would raise a permanent-failure alert for what is a recipient problem, not
  an outage. The discard is reported to `AdminAlerts` directly instead, since
  a discard never reaches `ObanFailureAlerter` (it emits `job:stop`, not
  `job:exception`) and a dead recipient — a host's payouts restricted, a
  dispute opened — is exactly the kind of silence an operator needs to know
  about.

  Translates a `Tymeslot.Emails.Delivery` failure `reason` into the Oban
  outcome for it: snooze past a provider-side "come back later" signal,
  discard a permanently rejected recipient, or fall back to an ordinary
  retry. `failure_message` is only used for that last, generic case.

  `metadata` may include `:executions` (how many times Oban has run the job,
  snoozes included, from `SnoozePolicy.executions/1`) to bound the snooze loops
  and to scale the `:rate_limited` snooze the same way `EmailWorker` does;
  callers that omit it get the formula's first-execution value. Passing
  `job.attempt` in its place leaves both loops unbounded, since a snooze does
  not advance `attempt` from Oban 2.24 on.
