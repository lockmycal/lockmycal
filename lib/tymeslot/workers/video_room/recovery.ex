defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoom.Recovery do
  @moduledoc """
  The long-tail recovery policy for video room creation.

  Ordinary retries are Oban's business: exponential backoff over the first few
  attempts, which covers a blip at the video provider. Past that the question
  stops being "retry sooner or later" and becomes "is there still time to get a
  join link in front of the attendees before they need it". That answer depends
  on the meeting rather than on the job, so it lives here rather than in the
  worker.

  ## The deadline is the earliest reminder, not the meeting start

  Reminder emails carry the join link, so a link written after the reminder went
  out is already too late even though the meeting has not started. The deadline
  is therefore the earliest reminder that will fire, falling back to the meeting
  start when a meeting has none, minus a small buffer so a reminder rendering at
  the same moment still picks the link up.

  Reminders come from the meeting when it carries its own, otherwise from its
  meeting type's configuration.

  ## Attempts are spread across the time that is left

  Rather than a fixed interval, each remaining attempt takes an even share of
  the time still available. A meeting an hour away is retried on a much tighter
  cadence than one three days out, and neither burns through its attempts early
  nor waits past its own deadline.

  ## The counter is executions, not `job.attempt`

  Recovery advances purely by snoozing, and from Oban 2.24 a snooze no longer
  advances `attempt`. The caller therefore passes
  `Tymeslot.Workers.SnoozePolicy.executions/1` — attempts and snoozes together
  — which is the number `attempt` used to carry. Bound against `attempt` alone
  this loop would never reach `@max_attempts`, leaving only the deadline to
  stop it and retrying a meeting booked far in advance far more than five
  times.
