defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.CalendarEventWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for handling calendar event creation and updates with intelligent retry logic.

  This worker handles:
  - Async creation of calendar events in CalDAV servers
  - Smart retry logic with progressive backoff
  - Error categorization for appropriate handling
  - Timeouts for CalDAV operations
  - Error notifications to calendar owner on persistent failures
  - Cancelling any pending "create"/"update" job for a meeting before its
    "delete" runs, so a stray retry from before the cancellation can't race
    the deletion and write the event back afterwards

  Total retry duration: ~18 minutes
  - 5 attempts with 90s timeout each = 450s
  - Backoff delays: 30s + 60s + 120s + 180s = 390s
  - Total: 840s ≈ 14 minutes (plus processing time ≈ 18 minutes)

  # 90 seconds for CalDAV operations (increased for background retries).
  #
  # Read at runtime rather than through `Application.compile_env/3`, which is
  # this project's default: a compiled-in constant cannot be lowered by the test
  # that exercises the timeout branch, so that test sat waiting out the full 90
  # seconds and was half the Core suite's wall clock on its own. One
  # `Application.get_env/3` per job is not a hot path.
  @default_calendar_timeout_ms 90_000

  # How long to wait behind another write to the same event, and for how many
  # executions. A CalDAV round trip is a second or two, so a handful of short
  # waits covers an ordinary one; a write wedged behind a slow server stops
  # waiting and takes its chances rather than snoozing out of sight.
  #
  # The budget is measured in executions, genuine attempts included, so a job
  # on its first run gets seven waits (roughly 14 to 21 seconds) and a retry
  # gets correspondingly fewer; from the eighth attempt on it never waits.

  # Oban's `unique` keeps a queued write from repeating one that has not begun,

  # this queue runs ten at a time. Two conditional PUTs against one event
  # cannot both win: the loser's `If-Match` names an ETag the winner has
  # already replaced, and the server answers 412.
  #
  # That costs the newer write, which is the one carrying whatever prompted it.
  # Approving a booking with a video meeting does exactly this: the approval's
  # update is still talking to the server when the room is created, and the
  # update that would carry the link collides with it. The host's entry then
  # sits without the link until the offline queue replays the write on its next
  # sync cycle, up to fifteen minutes later.
  #
  # Waiting is also what makes the write correct. A job that starts after the
  # one in flight has finished reads the meeting again, and so writes the video
  # link, the new title, the answer that changed — whatever landed while the
  # other write was on the wire.
