defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SendBookingPaymentRefunded do
  @moduledoc """
  Sends the attendee email confirming a booking-payment refund.

  Enqueued synchronously by `Tymeslot.MeetingPayments.Refunds.issue_refund/3`
  whenever a refund (full or partial) succeeds. The Stripe `charge.refunded`
  webhook reconciles `refunded_amount_cents` and `status` but does not
  re-enqueue the email — host-initiated refunds are the only path that
  notifies the attendee, matching §7 of the meeting-payments design.

  Loads a fresh booking-payment row inside `perform/1` so the email reflects
  the row's committed state, not whatever was in flight when the job was
  enqueued. Standard Oban retry semantics apply: up to five attempts on
  the `:emails` queue with the platform's CircuitBreaker handling
  upstream-mailer failures.

  The send is claimed through `Tymeslot.Workers.DeliveryClaims`, so a job the
  Oban lifeline rescues after the email went out does not send it again.
