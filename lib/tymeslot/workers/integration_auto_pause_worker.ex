defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.IntegrationAutoPauseWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Daily Oban cron job that pauses integrations whose health state has been
  unhealthy long enough that continuing to probe them is wasted work.
  Pausing sets `is_active: false` on the integration so the scheduled probe
  loop stops enqueueing work for it, and sends a one-off "paused"
  notification email. Each run raises at most one aggregate admin alert
  through `Tymeslot.Integrations.HealthCheck.Alerting.report_auto_pauses/2`.

  ## Triggers (dual threshold)

  Either of the following marks an integration as pausable:

    * **Sustained hard failures** — `consecutive_hard_failures >=
      :auto_pause_hard_failure_count` (default 168 ≈ ~7 days at the 1-hour
      unhealthy probe cadence). Catches the "token revoked, server gone"
      case quickly. The counter only ticks on hard failures and is reset by
      *any* success, so this cleanly excludes flappy integrations.

    * **Prolonged unhealthy streak** — `became_unhealthy_at <
      now - :auto_pause_cutoff_days` (default 14 days). Catches the
      ambiguous slow-decay case where probes occasionally succeed but the
      integration never reaches the 2-success healthy threshold. The
      `became_unhealthy_at` timestamp is reset by full recovery through the
      probe and by user actions (`HealthCheck.mark_user_recovered/2`), so a
      real recovery anywhere inside the 14 days clears the timer. A single
      successful sync deliberately does not: it clears only the failed-sync
      streak (`HealthCheck.mark_synced_successfully/2`), because otherwise a
      server answering one sync a day would reset this timer daily and never
      be paused.

  Both triggers also require the *current* status to be `"unhealthy"`, so an
  integration that's working today but was broken in the past is never
  paused.

  ## Why pause and not delete

  We never delete an integration on the user's behalf. Pausing preserves the
  user's settings, calendar selections, and history; reactivating restores
  the integration and resets the health monitor.

  ## Idempotency

  The pause query filters by `s.status == "unhealthy"`, so an already-paused
  integration won't be picked up again on the next run (its row is unchanged
  because the probe loop skips inactive integrations and never updates the
  status). The "paused" email scheduler also has a 90-day uniqueness window
  as a belt-and-suspenders defence against duplicates.
