defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.ObanMaintenanceWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Performs regular maintenance on Oban jobs:

  1. Cleans up stuck jobs in "executing" state
  2. Deletes delivery claims (`Tymeslot.Workers.DeliveryClaims`) whose job
     Oban has pruned
  3. Provides metrics and logging for job health monitoring

  This worker runs every 30 minutes to ensure job queue health.

  Discarding a stuck job is the last rung of the ladder in
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.ObanRescue`, not the first: `Oban.Lifeline` returns
  an abandoned job to `available` hours earlier, so anything still `executing`
  by the time this sweep sees it is a row the lifeline never reached, on an
  installation that has none configured or whose leader is unreachable. The
  threshold comes from `ObanRescue.discard_after_hours/0` for that reason: a
  discarded job never runs again, so this sweep must never pre-empt the rescue
  that would have recovered the work.

  Terminal-job retention (completed/discarded/cancelled) is handled by
  `Oban.Plugins.Pruner`, not here: its `max_age` is a week in every
  environment, so a second sweep with a longer window would never find
  anything left to delete.
