defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncCalDavCalendarWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker that syncs a CalDAV calendar integration.

  The protocol work lives in `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Sync`,
  which reports outcomes without deciding what they mean. This module supplies
  that decision: which failures are worth another attempt, which are permanent
  until someone reconnects, and which need the integration flagged in the
  dashboard first.

  ## Per-integration deduplication

  `unique: [period: 300, keys: [:calendar_integration_id]]` prevents duplicate
  jobs from accumulating when a sweep worker or external trigger enqueues a job
  for an integration that already has one queued or running. A requested full
  fetch (`enqueue_full_fetch/1`) is the exception that is not absorbed: it
  upgrades a waiting job, or makes a running one run again, see
  `Tymeslot.Workers.SyncRequest`.

  ## Auth errors (REQ-012)

  A 401 or 403 flags the integration's `needs_reauth` field and returns
  `{:discard, …}` — no retry, since the failure is permanent until the user
  reconnects. If the DB write itself fails the worker returns `{:error, …}` so
  Oban retries and takes another shot at recording the flag. The `is_active`
  flag is left unchanged so the integration stays visible in the dashboard.
