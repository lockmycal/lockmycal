  Sends the invitee's acknowledgement and the host's request.

  The two are independent notifications to different people, so neither
  gates the other: both are attempted on every execution, and the host leg
  runs whether or not the invitee's acknowledgement succeeded. A permanently
  rejected or slow-to-retry invitee address must never leave the host
  unaware a booking request exists at all.

  Both are guarded on the meeting still being held. A request answered, or
  withdrawn by the invitee, between enqueue and execution must not produce an
  email telling either party it is still open.

  `args["skip_attendee_ack"]` / `args["skip_host_request"]` are set only by
  `retry_failed_leg/3` below, when one leg already went out and only the
  other failed: it requeues a single-leg follow-up so a later Oban retry (of
  either the original job or the follow-up) can never duplicate the leg that
  already succeeded.
