defmodule Tymeslot.Auth.AdminRoles do
  @moduledoc """
  Domain logic for the admin role lifecycle.

  This module is the single entry point for promoting and demoting admin users.
  Both the LiveView admin UI and the CLI release helpers route through here,
  ensuring that all business rules (last-admin guard, audit logging) are
  applied consistently.

  Only two actors may change a role: a user who is an admin *now* (the flag is
  re-read from the database inside the transaction, so a stale struct from a
  long-lived session does not count) and `:cli`, the operator running a
  release or Mix task. Anyone else gets `{:error, :forbidden}`: the admin UI's
  `EnsureAdminHook` is not the only guard.

  Self-demotion is allowed for admin actors as long as at least one
  other admin remains; the `:last_admin` guard is what prevents stranding the
  install. The `:cli` actor additionally skips the last-admin guard, providing
  an operator escape hatch when the UI cannot be used (e.g. to recover a
  stranded install where every admin has been demoted).
