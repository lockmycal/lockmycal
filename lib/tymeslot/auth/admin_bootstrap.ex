defmodule Tymeslot.Auth.AdminBootstrap do
  @moduledoc """
  First-user-becomes-admin bootstrap for self-hosted installs.

  The first user to register on a fresh install is promoted to admin in the
  same transaction as their insert. The bootstrap then closes for good: the
  `admin_bootstrapped_at` timestamp on the `app_settings` singleton is set in
  that transaction, and while it is set nobody else is promoted this way.
  Further admins come only from an existing admin or from
  `mix tymeslot.promote_admin` / `Tymeslot.Release.promote_admin/1`.

  The timestamp is what makes the gate one-way. Deciding by "is this user the
  only row in the table?" alone reopened it whenever the table emptied again,
  so if the sole user deleted their account, the next stranger to sign up
  became admin. Installs that already had users when the column was added are
  marked bootstrapped by its migration.

  Closing it is an atomic claim (`AppSettingsQueries.claim_admin_bootstrap/1`):
  of two concurrent first sign-ups, the second waits for the first to commit
  and then finds nothing to claim, so exactly one can be promoted. Once the
  bootstrap is closed, a sign-up sees so from a plain read and returns at
  once, so an established install never contends for the settings row.

  Promotes `user` to admin if the install has not been bootstrapped yet and
  `user` is its only user, and closes the bootstrap either way. Once closed,
  returns the user unchanged.

  Call it in the same transaction as the user insert, so the claim and the
  "only user" check are committed or rolled back with it. Called outside a
  transaction it opens its own. Two calling conventions are supported:

    * **Explicit repo** (recommended when using `Repo.transaction(fn repo -> end)`):
      pass the transaction's repo as the second argument so all queries in the
      callback use the same checked-out connection.

    * **Implicit Repo** (acceptable when calling from `Repo.transaction(fn -> end)`
      on the same process): omit the second argument. Ecto tracks the checked-out
      connection via the process dictionary, so the default `Repo` resolves to the
      same connection automatically.
