defmodule Tymeslot.Announcements.Catalog do
  @moduledoc """
  Core's canonical source of feature announcements. Add a new entry every time
  a noteworthy user-facing feature ships.

  User-facing content (`title`, `body`, `bullets`, `cta_label`) is translated
  through the `onboarding` gettext domain — the same domain that owns the modal
  chrome. Because `list/0` resolves these `dgettext/2` calls when it runs, and it
  runs on connected dashboard mount with the request locale already set, each
  user sees announcements in their own language. Every new string added here
  must be translated into all supported locales or the gettext completeness test
  fails.

  The `:key` MUST be globally unique and never change after release — it is the
  identity used in `user_seen_announcements`, and unlike the copy it is not a
  translatable string.
