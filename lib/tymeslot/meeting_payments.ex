defmodule Tymeslot.MeetingPayments do
  @moduledoc """
  Main entry point for meeting-payments operations.

  Provides a high-level interface covering Stripe Connect onboarding,
  booking payments, refunds, currency management, and data retention.
  All external callers (web, workers, email templates, cross-domain
  modules, SaaS) must interact with this module — never with submodules
  directly.

  ## Public struct types

  `BookingPaymentSchema` and `ConnectAccountSchema` are intentionally
  part of this module's public API surface, exposed via the `t:booking_payment/0`
  and `t:account/0` type declarations respectively. Callers may alias these
  schema modules **solely to pattern-match on structs returned by facade
  functions** — for example, in `perform/1` clause heads of Oban workers
  that dispatch on struct fields.

  The following uses remain prohibited for all external callers:

    * Direct `Repo.*` calls against these schemas
    * Constructing or applying changesets (`Ecto.Changeset`)
    * Calling any function defined in the submodule itself

  Pattern-matching on a `%BookingPaymentSchema{}` or `%ConnectAccountSchema{}`
  value that was *returned by this facade* is permitted and does not constitute
  a layering violation.
