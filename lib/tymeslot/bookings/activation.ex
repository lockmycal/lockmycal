defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.Activation do
  @moduledoc """
  Turning a confirmed meeting into a booking the world knows about.

  Two paths arrive at the same point. A booking on an ordinary meeting type is
  confirmed the moment it is created; a booking on a meeting type requiring
  manual approval is confirmed later, when the host says yes. From that point
  on the work is identical: create the video room if the meeting has a
  provider, then send the confirmation emails and fan out to webhooks,
  Telegram and Slack.

  It lives in its own module so the two paths cannot drift. The ordering
  matters and is easy to get wrong from a second call site: the video room is
  created *before* the emails so the join link is in the confirmation the
  attendee receives, rather than arriving in a later correction. Where a
  provider is configured, that means handing both steps to
  `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoomWorker`, which sends the emails itself once the
  room exists — and falls back to sending them without a link if the provider
  is unreachable, so a broken video integration never costs the attendee their
  confirmation.

  # `notify/1`. Deriving it, instead of restating the provider list by hand,
  # is what keeps a newly registered provider from being missed here the way
  # kMeet and Jitsi once were; the assertion below is a second line of
  # defence against `known_providers/0` ever growing the `:none` sentinel

  Runs the side effects a newly created or newly confirmed meeting needs.

  A meeting still awaiting the host's approval takes the request fan-out; any
  other status takes the confirmation one.

  With `with_video_room: true` the caller asserts the booking flow wants a
  room whenever the meeting has an integration; without it, the provider is
  auto-detected and only the API-backed ones defer the emails.

  Always returns `:ok`. Every failure here is recoverable and separately
  retried — the meeting itself is already committed, and refusing to return
  success would only invite callers to roll back a booking that exists.
