  Schedules a calendar event job for a meeting.

  Handles both creation and update actions with appropriate priority levels.
  Treats duplicate job scheduling (unique constraint) as a non-error success case.

  - meeting: The meeting struct containing the ID
  - action: The action to perform, either "create" or "update"

  ## Returns
  - {:ok, :scheduled} if the job was successfully created
  - {:ok, :already_scheduled} if a job with the same parameters already exists
  - {:error, changeset} if job insertion fails for other reasons
