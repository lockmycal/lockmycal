  Creates ad-hoc meetings directly from the dashboard calendar.

  Unlike `Bookings.Create`, this does not require a meeting type or booking form.
  The organiser provides attendee details and timing directly, and the system
  creates a full Meeting record with calendar sync, email notifications, and
  optional video room provisioning.

  # to go out beside the confirmation, leaving the guest with two emails for
  # one booking: the confirmation in their language, carrying the ICS file, the
  # accept/decline links and the video link, and a bare "You're Invited" with
  # none of those. It was not initialising anything either, whatever the
  # comment here claimed — `AttendeeNotifications.event_created/2` only sends,

  # worker, never on create. The baseline stays empty here exactly as it does
