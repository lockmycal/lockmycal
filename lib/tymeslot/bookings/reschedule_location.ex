defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.RescheduleLocation do
  @moduledoc """
  Where a rescheduled meeting is held, when the booker picks somewhere new.

  A meeting type offering several locations lets the booker choose one when
  booking, and the reschedule form offers the same choice again, opened on the
  location the meeting already has. Most reschedules leave it alone, and then
  this module changes nothing.

  ## Changing the location is not just a column update

  The location decides whether the meeting has a provider-side video room, and
  on which integration. So a change is resolved in two halves:

    * `attributes/3` is the write. It returns the location fields to merge
      into the reschedule's update, and, whenever the new location is not on
      the integration that owns the current room, blanks every room field in
      the same write. The meeting then never advertises a join link for a
      place it is no longer held, even for the moment before the provider
      catches up.

    * `release_abandoned_room/2` and `create_room/2` are the provider side,
      run after the write commits. They read the change off the meeting's
      before and after states rather than being told about it, so they cannot
      disagree with what was actually persisted.

  In both directions the rule is the same: the old room is deleted
  (`Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker.release/1`), and a room is created on the
  new integration where there is one (`Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoomWorker`).
  Moving between two options on the *same* integration keeps the room, whose
  times the ordinary reschedule sync already moves.

  A new room also takes over the reschedule's announcement, exactly as a new
  booking's room takes over its confirmation: the email is the attendee's one
  message about the move, and sent before the room exists it would carry no
  join link.

  ## The booker submits an id, never a location

  As on a new booking, everything the choice means is re-derived from the
  host's own meeting type (`MeetingTypes.resolve_location/3`). Unlike a new
  booking, an id the meeting type does not offer is ignored rather than
  resolved to the first option: a reschedule already has a location, and a
  stale or forged id must not move it anywhere.

  Schedules a room for a confirmed meeting a reschedule left on a video
  integration without one, handing it the reschedule's announcement.

  That is a meeting the reschedule moved onto a new video integration, and
  equally one whose room was still on its way when the reschedule came: an
  earlier job owes the announcement of the time it was booked or rescheduled
  to, which this reschedule makes stale, so that job drops it
  (`Tymeslot.Workers.VideoRoom.Announcement.deliver/3`). Sent from here, the
  email would go out before the room exists and carry no link, so it is
  handed to a job of its own; whichever job creates the room, the other finds
  it attached and announces with the link.

  Returns `:scheduled` when the room's job now owns the announcement, and
  `:not_scheduled` when the caller still has to send it.

  Only a confirmed meeting gets one here. A booking still held for approval,
  or not yet paid for, is given its room by the path that confirms it, exactly
  as a new booking is.
