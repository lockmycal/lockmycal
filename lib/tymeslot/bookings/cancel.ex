  Cancels a meeting by its ID.

  # cancellation email carries user-facing context (cancellation reason, custom copy)

  # 5xx/429 retries instead of leaving an orphaned meeting. Providers without a
  # server-side meeting object (Google Meet, MiroTalk, Custom) resolve to
  # :ok inside the job. Whether an integration can still reach the room is

  # `video_integration_id` does not mean the room stopped existing. Never blocks
