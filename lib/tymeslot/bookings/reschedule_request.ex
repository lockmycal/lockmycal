defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.RescheduleRequest do
  @moduledoc """
  Handles reschedule request workflow for meetings.

  This module manages the process when an organizer requests to reschedule a meeting:
  1. Validates the meeting is eligible for rescheduling (via Policy) and that
     a request isn't already pending — a duplicate request is rejected
     rather than re-voiding the slot and re-emailing the attendee
  2. Marks the meeting as awaiting a new time (`reschedule_requested_at`) —
     `status` is left untouched, so the underlying lifecycle status (pending,
     awaiting_payment, confirmed) survives the request instead of being
     overwritten and lost
  3. Deletes pending reminder emails and queues the reschedule request email
     atomically, so the attendee is always told once the slot is voided
  4. Schedules deletion of the calendar event — the original time slot is
     void, exactly as if the meeting were cancelled, until the attendee
     books a new time

  This is distinct from `Bookings.Reschedule` which actually performs the reschedule
  with a new time. This module only initiates the request workflow.

  Sends a reschedule request email for a meeting.

  This function:
  1. Checks if the meeting is eligible for rescheduling via Policy, and that
     no reschedule request is already pending
  2. Marks the meeting as awaiting a new time (`reschedule_requested_at`)
  3. Deletes pending reminder email jobs and queues a high-priority email
     job to notify the attendee, atomically — either both happen or neither
     does, so the slot is never voided without the attendee being told
  4. Schedules deletion of the calendar event (fire-and-forget)

  ## Parameters
    - meeting: The meeting struct to send reschedule request for

  ## Returns
    - :ok on success
    - {:error, reason} on failure

  # Postgres operations, so they run in one transaction: if the email job
  # can't be durably enqueued, the slot update rolls back too, rather than
  # leaving the meeting voided with no email on its way. Calendar event
  # deletion is scheduled last, outside the transaction — it's an external
  # side effect that already never fails the caller (see
  # `Meetings.cancel_calendar_event/1`), and rebooking recreates both the
  # calendar event (via the update-404 path) and reminders (via the
  # meeting_rescheduled event).
