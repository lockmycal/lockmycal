  Resets the health state row to a known-healthy baseline.

  Used when the user has produced an unambiguous success signal — a credentials
  update or a reactivation — that proves the integration works regardless of
  what the last scheduled probe said. Without this, the in-app badge can lag the
  truth by up to an hour while waiting for the next scheduled probe.

  A successful *sync* is deliberately not one of those signals: it calls
  `clear_sync_failures/2` instead, which zeroes the streak and leaves the
  unhealthy episode standing. See that function for why.

  `successes` counts consecutive successful probes, and a reset has run none,
  so it starts at zero like every other counter here. It needs no head start
  towards the recovery threshold: the row is written as healthy, and
  `Monitor.determine_status/3` keeps a healthy row healthy on its next
  success. Any probe that does leave the row non-healthy zeroes the counter on
  its way, so a seeded value could never be read.

  Clears the failed-sync streak after a sync cycle completes.

  This is the whole reset path for `consecutive_sync_failures`, the counter
  `Monitor.record_sync_failure/1` raises the unhealthy badge from: nothing else
  zeroes it.

  It writes that one column and nothing else, and the omissions are the point.
  `status`, `became_unhealthy_at` and `notification_sent_at` describe an
  unhealthy *episode*, and a single successful sync is not evidence the episode
  has ended — a server that refuses most syncs while succeeding about once a day
  is exactly the case the streak exists to catch. Clearing them here would
  restart the 48-hour notification clock on every one of those successes, so the
  badge would flap daily and the owner's email would never fire.

  Ending the episode is the probe's job: two consecutive successful probes take
  the row back to `:healthy` through the flap protection in
  `Monitor.determine_status/3`, and the resulting `:became_healthy` transition
  is where `ResponseHandler` clears the timestamps. Keeping recovery in that one
  place is why this function does not attempt its own.
