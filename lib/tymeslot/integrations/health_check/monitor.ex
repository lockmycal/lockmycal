  Records one failed sync cycle and returns the new health state.

  Sync failures are tracked separately from probe failures because they are
  evidence the probe cannot produce. The probe PROPFINDs a collection; sync
  issues a REPORT against it. A server can answer one and refuse the other —
  Infomaniak did, 500ing every incremental REPORT for a CalDAV integration for
  eleven days while the collection answered everything else — and in that state
  the probe is honestly, uselessly healthy. Once the streak reaches
  `sync_failure_threshold/0` the row is forced `:unhealthy` so the badge, the
  48-hour notification and the auto-pause sweep all see the outage.

  The streak is cleared by `IntegrationHealthStateQueries.clear_sync_failures/2`,
  which a successful sync reaches through
  `HealthCheck.mark_synced_successfully/2`. That clears the counter and nothing
  else: recovery of the *status*, and of `became_unhealthy_at` with it, is left
  to the probe, so the existing flap protection in `determine_status/3` still
  governs how quickly a badge clears and one lucky sync a day cannot keep
  restarting the 48-hour notification clock.

  `consecutive_hard_failures` is deliberately untouched: that counter drives
  `SyncGating`, and a remote 5xx is exactly the case where pausing sync would
  stop the integration ever discovering the server had recovered.
