defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.MeetingProvisioning do
  @moduledoc """
  Cross-context orchestration: given a `(calendar_integration_id, video_integration_id,
  user_id, event_details)` tuple, decides whether to ask the calendar provider to
  provision the video link inline (via `conferenceData.createRequest`) or to provision
  it separately and stitch the URL into the event description afterwards.

  ## Strategies

  * `:none` — no video integration requested.
  * `{:inline, video_id}` — Google Calendar and Google Meet share the same Google
    account. Attaching `conferenceData.createRequest` to the calendar create/update
    call lets Google provision the Meet link in a single round-trip and avoids
    creating a duplicate calendar event.
  * `{:attach, video_id}`: an Outlook calendar and Microsoft Teams sharing the
    same Microsoft account. A Teams meeting is itself an Outlook event, so the
    calendar event is written first and the Teams provider then switches the
    online meeting on for that very event (its `:calendar_event_id` option),
    rather than creating a second event to carry the meeting. Kept apart from
    `:inline` because nothing is added to the calendar write itself: in
    particular it never reaches `attach_conference_data/2`, whose payload only
    Google understands.
  * `{:separate, video_id}` — any other combination. The video provider is called
    independently and the resulting URL is written into the event description.

  An edit follows the same plan: `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.change_event_video/3`
  sends `conferenceData` with `conferenceDataVersion=1` on the update when the
  plan is `:inline`, and reads the event back for the link Google made, since
  the update's own answer does not reach it. On `:attach` it has the Teams
  provider attach the meeting to the existing event.

  Where a booking's Microsoft Teams meeting belongs.

  A Teams meeting is an Outlook calendar event with an online meeting on it.
  When the booking is written to an Outlook calendar of the same Microsoft
  account as its Teams integration, that event already exists, so the meeting
  is attached to it and the organiser's calendar holds one entry for the
  booking instead of two:

  * `{:calendar_event, provider_event_id}` — attach it to the booking's event.
  * `:awaiting_calendar_event` — it belongs on the booking's event, which
    `Tymeslot.Workers.CalendarEventWorker` has not written yet. Creating a
    separate event meanwhile is exactly the duplicate this avoids, so the
    caller waits for it, for up to two minutes from the booking; after that
    the answer becomes `:own_event`.
  * `:own_event` — any other combination, including a Teams account that is
    not the calendar's (a host can connect several Outlook accounts): the
    meeting needs an event of its own.
