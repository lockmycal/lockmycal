defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Recurrence.RRule do
  @moduledoc """
  Builds and parses RFC-5545 RRULE strings for the calendar grid's recurrence
  editor. Pure data transformations — no side effects.

  The supported surface matches the recurrence editor UI: a frequency
  (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), an `INTERVAL` ("every N"), an optional `BYDAY`
  weekday selection for weekly rules, and one of two mutually-exclusive end
  conditions — `COUNT` (after N occurrences) or `UNTIL` (on a date). Complex
  rules (BYSETPOS, BYMONTH, multiple BYxxx parts) are intentionally out of
  scope; `parse/2` ignores tokens it does not understand rather than failing.

  The canonical option map shape used by both functions:

      %{
        freq: :daily | :weekly | :monthly | :yearly,
        interval: pos_integer() | nil,
        by_day: [:mo | :tu | :we | :th | :fr | :sa | :su],
        count: pos_integer() | nil,
        until: Date.t() | nil
      }

  ## `UNTIL` and the event's timezone

  `:until` is the calendar date the organiser picked, which is a *local* date:
  it has no timezone of its own. On the wire it is written differently
  depending on the event it bounds (RFC 5545 §3.3.10, "UNTIL MUST be the same
  value type as DTSTART"):

    * an all-day event's `DTSTART` is a DATE, so `UNTIL` is a bare `YYYYMMDD`,
      zone-free in both directions;
    * a timed event's `DTSTART` is a DATE-TIME, so `UNTIL` is an *instant* in
      UTC — the end of the chosen day in the event's own timezone.

  That second form is why `build/2`, `parse/2` and `retarget/2` all take a
  `:timezone`: end-of-day in Los Angeles and end-of-day in Auckland are
  different instants, and both fall on a UTC date the organiser never picked.
  Stamping `T235959Z` on the local date instead ends the series a day early
  west of UTC and a day late east of it. The option is threaded through all
  three so the value written and the value read back agree, which also makes
  `retarget/2` idempotent.

  Without a `:timezone` the UTC day is used in both directions, which is the
  right answer for a rule that is already expressed in UTC (an Outlook range,
  a legacy stored rule) and the wrong one for an organiser's local date.

  Builds an RFC-5545 RRULE string from the canonical option map.

  Parts are emitted in a stable order: `FREQ`, `INTERVAL` (only when > 1),
  `BYDAY` (only when non-empty), then the end condition. `COUNT` wins over
  `UNTIL` when both are supplied.

  The optional `all_day:` keyword controls the `UNTIL` value type (RFC 5545
  §3.3.10): when `true`, UNTIL is emitted as a bare date (`YYYYMMDD`) to match
  the DATE-form `DTSTART` of an all-day event. When `false` (the default),
  UNTIL is the instant that ends `:until` in `timezone:`, written in UTC, so
  the chosen calendar date is fully included wherever the organiser is.

  ## Options
    - `:all_day` — boolean, default `false`
    - `:timezone` — the event's timezone, used to resolve a timed `UNTIL`.
      Defaults to `nil`, which ends the day in UTC.

  Fits a rule's `UNTIL` to the event it repeats.

  The recurrence editor composes a rule before the event's all-day flag and
  start date are final, so a rule has to be checked against the event it is
  saved with rather than the one the form showed when the end date was
  picked. Two things are checked:

    * `UNTIL` must not fall before `:start_date`, or the series would have
      no occurrences at all (`{:error, :until_before_start}`); the check is
      skipped when no start date is given;
    * `UNTIL` must have the value type of `DTSTART` (RFC 5545 §3.3.10), so it
      is rewritten as a bare date for an all-day event and as an end-of-day
      instant for a timed one, as `build/2` would emit it.

  Only the `UNTIL` part is rewritten; every other part, including ones
  `parse/2` does not understand, is kept as it was. A `nil` rule stays `nil`.

  The rule is read back in `timezone:` before it is rewritten in it, so
  retargeting the same rule twice is a no-op rather than walking its end date
  one day further each time.

  ## Options
