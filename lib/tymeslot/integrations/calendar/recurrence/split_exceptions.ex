defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Recurrence.SplitExceptions do
  @moduledoc """
  Carrying a Google or Outlook series' occurrences edited or cancelled on
  their own across a split (see `Recurrence.SeriesSplit`): what both
  providers share. `Google.SeriesExceptions` and `Outlook.SeriesExceptions`
  read each provider's exceptions into `t:exception/0` and write the tail's
  matching occurrences.

  Both providers keep such an occurrence apart from the master's rule, and
  drop it once the master is ended before it, so the tail, a new series,
  starts without it. Each one from the split's slot on is read before the
  split is written, and then written again to the tail's occurrence that
  takes its place: the one whose original start is the exception's, moved
  by as much as the edit moved the series. A cancelled occurrence is
  cancelled there; an edited one takes what it had of its own:

    * **fields** that differ from the master's as it was before the edit,
      so an occurrence renamed on its own keeps its name while the rest of
      the tail takes the edit's;
    * **timing**, when it was moved or given another length on its own. It
      moves with the series, and keeps its own length unless it lasted as
      long as the series did, when it takes the series' new length, as a
      CalDAV override does (`ICalBuilder.Series.edit_master/5`).

  An exception whose place the tail does not have, because the edit gave
  the series a new rule, cannot be carried. The split is written by then,
  so neither that nor a failed write fails it: `carry/2` counts and logs
  them.
