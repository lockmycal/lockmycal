  Walks a Google Calendar events listing to its last page.

  Every listing `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Google.CalendarAPI` makes goes
  through here: a windowed read of one calendar, the bootstrap, a sync-token
  delta, and the events of one series. They differ only in their base
  params, so they share one loop rather than holding copies of it: before
  PR #94 the incremental path had no pagination at all while bootstrap had it
  correct, and the windowed read of a secondary calendar kept only its first
  page until the sync began inferring deletions from what that read leaves
  out.

  `{:ok, _}` is only ever a complete listing: every page was read. A page
  that fails ends the walk with that page's error, and so does the page cap,
  so a caller never mistakes a truncated listing for the whole calendar.

  # Google's own maximum per page. Set here rather than by any caller, so the
  # page size cannot drift between listings again: the incremental path was
  # taking Google's default of 250 where bootstrap asked for 2500, about 18
  # sequential round-trips for a 4,465-event backlog where 2 would do.

  # No listing loop had any bound on iterations: a provider echoing the same
  # page token would occupy one of the ten `calendar_events` queue slots
  # permanently, with nothing in the logs to say why:
  # `SyncGoogleCalendarWorker` defines no `timeout/1`, so Oban's `:infinity`
  # default applies. At 2500 events a page this cap is far past any real
  # calendar, so hitting it means the provider is misbehaving, and saying so
  # beats looping in silence.
