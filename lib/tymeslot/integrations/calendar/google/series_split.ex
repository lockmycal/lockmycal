defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Google.SeriesSplit do
  @moduledoc """
  The two writes that split a Google recurring event in two at one of its
  occurrences, for an edit of that occurrence and every one after it (see
  `Recurrence.SeriesSplit`). Pure data: the provider reads the master, and
  writes what this builds.

    * **The tail** is inserted as a new event: the master's own fields, with
      `start` and `end` at the slot in the master's `timeZone` and the length
      the master has, and the master's `recurrence` lines from the slot on:
      the `RRULE` with its `COUNT` less the occurrences before the slot (an
      `UNTIL` kept as it is), and the `EXDATE` and `RDATE` values at or
      after the slot. The edit is then applied to it by `Google.SeriesPatch`
      as an edit of every occurrence, so a move, a new rule and new fields
      land on the tail alone.
    * **The head** is the master patched with its `recurrence` alone: the
      `RRULE` ends just before the slot, its `UNTIL` in the value type RFC
      5545 requires (the day before for an all-day series, the UTC instant a
      second before for a timed one), and the `EXDATE` and `RDATE` values at
      or after the slot go.

  The tail is built from the master as `Google.CreatableEvent` makes any
  event creatable: what Google assigns or manages itself is not copied, and
  a conference is copied as the join details it has, so the tail's
  occurrences keep the series' Meet link.

  Occurrences edited or cancelled on their own in Google are separate
  events that name the master, which Google drops once the master's rule no
  longer makes their slot. They are not part of these bodies: the provider
  carries those from the slot on to the tail once it is written
  (`Google.SeriesExceptions`).
