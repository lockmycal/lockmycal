  Meeting-level reconciliation logic for external calendar changes.

  This module owns change *detection* when a sync worker reports provider
  events that may be linked to Tymeslot meetings. It is provider-agnostic —
  all sync workers (Google, CalDAV, Outlook, etc.) call `reconcile/4` with a
  normalised signal.

  The meeting-side consequences of a detected change (sync-status updates,
  auto-cancellation, host notifications) belong to the Meetings context and
  are delegated to `Tymeslot.Meetings.apply_external_calendar_change/4`.

  Cache writes happen in the sync workers themselves. This module only runs
  when a linked Tymeslot meeting is found.

  Persists a batch of normalised calendar events to the local cache and
  performs downstream side effects.

  Called by every sync worker after its provider-specific `normalise_events/2`
  returns. This is the single point where canonical `CalendarEvent` structs
  become rows in the cache — no sync worker should upsert directly.

  Steps:
  1. Convert each event to cache attrs via `from_calendar_event/1`.
  2. Upsert the batch in a single query.
  3. Invalidate the user's availability cache so subsequent slot lookups
     reflect the newly persisted events.
  4. Broadcast a cache update so live grids refresh.
  5. Reconcile any linked Tymeslot meetings whose times changed externally.

  This function is a convenience wrapper around `upsert_cache/2` and
  `post_commit_reconciliation/2` — callers that need to run the cache
  write inside a `Repo.transaction` alongside other DB work (e.g. the
  CalDAV atomic reconciler) should call those two halves separately.

  Replaces every cached row an integration holds under one `role`, in a single
  transaction, with the given events.

  For providers whose sync has more than one read path writing into the same
  integration. Exchange is the only one today: its busy-time read owns the
  `busy_only` rows and its item read owns the `display_only` ones, and an
  unscoped full refresh would have each half delete the other's rows every
  cycle.

  Pure DB write. **No `post_commit_reconciliation/2`, deliberately**, and not
  merely as the read-only-mirror argument `SyncIcsCalendarWorker` makes:
  reconciliation resolves a vanished event to a Tymeslot meeting *by uid*
  (`Meetings.ExternalCalendarChanges.find_linked_meeting/3`) and cancels it,
  notifying both parties. Rows written through here can carry a synthesised
  uid, because a busy interval arrives with no identity of any kind, so a uid
  collision would cancel a real confirmed booking. The synthesised uids are
  namespaced to make that collision unreachable; not running the
  reconciliation at all is the structural half of the same defence, and both
  are wanted.

  Ownership *is* flagged here, unlike reconciliation. `flag_tymeslot_owned/2`
  only ever raises `created_by_tymeslot` on a row that matches one of this
  integration's own meetings, so it cannot mislabel a synthesised busy
  interval, and Exchange reaches the cache through this function alone —
  without it, a booking mirrored to an Exchange calendar stays unowned and
  `CalDAV.OfflineQueue`-style recovery keyed on that flag never applies to it.

  Removes externally deleted provider events from the local cache and
  reconciles any linked Tymeslot meetings.

  This is the deletion-side counterpart of `persist_normalised_events/2` —
  the single primitive all sync workers use when a provider reports deleted
  events. For each ref:

  1. The cache rows are deleted, each ref by its `:uid` when it has one,
     falling back to `:provider_event_id`. Pass `delete_cache: false` when
     the cache rows were already deleted inside an enclosing
     `Repo.transaction` (e.g. the CalDAV atomic reconciler) and only the
     post-commit reconciliation side effects remain.
  2. The linked meeting (if any) is reconciled with `:deleted`. Reconcile
     failures are logged as warnings and do not abort the remaining refs —
     a failed auto-cancellation reverts its own sync status and is retried
     by the next sync run.

  Both steps are batched: the whole list costs two `DELETE`s and one `SELECT`
  rather than roughly three round-trips per ref, which matters because the
  common case is a cancelled event with no linked meeting paying the full
  cost to learn there is nothing to do. A backlog drain after a stuck sync
  token can be thousands of events in one job.

  Duplicate refs are collapsed, and so are two refs resolving to one meeting.
  Not for the database's sake (a batched `DELETE … WHERE uid IN (…)` is
  indifferent to duplicates, unlike the `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` in
  `upsert_batch/1`), and not for correctness either, since
  `update_calendar_sync_status_if_changed/2` already makes a repeated signal a
  no-op. It simply saves the repeated round-trip.

  Always returns `:ok`.
