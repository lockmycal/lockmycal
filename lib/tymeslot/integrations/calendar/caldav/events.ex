defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Events do
  @moduledoc """
  CalDAV event operations domain.

  Owns the full lifecycle of calendar event CRUD:

  - **ETag-conditional updates**: callers pass the cached ETag via `:etag`
    in `opts` for a direct conditional PUT with `If-Match`. When no cached
    ETag is available, the module falls back to a HEAD probe, then a GET
    for servers that refuse HEAD, and finally to `If-Match: *`. Prevents
    lost updates on concurrent edits.
  - **Conflict resolution policy**: on `412 Precondition Failed`, the
    caller chooses one of `:fail | :keep_server | :keep_local` via
    `:conflict_resolution` in `opts`. See `ConflictResolution` for the
    semantics of each value. A server that answers a conditional PUT with
    `409` instead of `412` follows the same policy when a real ETag was
    sent; when only `If-Match: *` was sent the write is simply replayed
    unconditionally, since that condition guarded nothing. The write itself
    is `ConditionalWrite`'s.
  - **Series writes**: one occurrence of a series is deleted or edited,
    every occurrence edited, or the series split in two for an edit of one
    occurrence and every following one, by rewriting the series' resource,
    see `delete_occurrence/4`, `update_occurrence/4`, `update_series/4` and
    `split_series/4` (carried out by `CalDAV.SeriesWrites`).
  - **iCal construction**: builds valid RFC 5545 event payloads from domain maps.
  - **Per-operation retry policies**: reads retry on transient failures.
  - **Circuit breaker protection** for all operations.

  Callers receive parsed domain types — never raw HTTP responses, XML, or iCal.

  Updates an existing event.

  Uses a conditional `If-Match` write to prevent lost updates when two
  parties edit the same event concurrently. The caller should supply the
  cached ETag via `opts[:etag]`; when absent, the function falls back to a
  HEAD probe, then a GET, and finally to `If-Match: *` if neither finds one.

  ## Patched versus rebuilt

  An event that arrived by sync is **patched**: `event_data[:raw_ical]` is the
  document the provider last gave us, `ICalBuilder.patch_event_properties/3`
  rewrites the properties the payload carries, and the rest of the document —
  the `ATTENDEE` block with its `PARTSTAT`, `CATEGORIES`, `X-` properties —
  goes back untouched. Rebuilding it from the payload instead would erase all
  of that, since `build_simple_event/3` serialises what Tymeslot models and
  nothing else.

  An event with no `:raw_ical` is **rebuilt**, which is the right writer for a
  booking Tymeslot authored and the only one available before the first sync.

  A patched write replaces the event's `VALARM`s with the payload's
  `:reminders`, unless the payload sets `keep_stored_alarms: true`, as a
  booking update does (see `CalDAV.BookingDocument`): then the stored alarms
  stay, and only a rebuild writes `:reminders`.

  A patched write is only ever applied to a document whose ETag we hold: the
  cached pair when the caller supplies both, otherwise the server's current
  copy, read first. A rejected precondition re-reads the event and patches
  that copy rather than forcing a stale document through, so the organiser's
  change lands on top of whatever else happened to the event instead of
  reverting it.
