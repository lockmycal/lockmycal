defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Sync do
  @moduledoc """
  Runs a full or incremental sync of a CalDAV calendar integration.

  ## Sync Tiers

  CalDAV servers vary widely in their protocol support. The tier is probed once
  per integration and stored in `caldav_sync_tier`:

  - **Tier 1** – Server supports `DAV:sync-token` (RFC 6578). A path with no
    token reads the current one as a property and fetches the sync window in
    full; from then on, a sync-collection REPORT carrying that token returns
    just the delta since that point.

  - **Tier 2** – Server supports `cs:getctag` (Apple/Sabre extension). A
    lightweight PROPFIND checks whether the CTag has changed, skipping the
    event fetch entirely when the calendar is unchanged.

  - **Tier 3** – Fallback: a full PROPFIND + REPORT calendar-query on every
    run. Required for basic servers supporting neither extension.

  Tiers 1 and 2 are scoped to a single collection, so each configured calendar
  path runs the tier's mechanism on its own, against its own entry in
  `caldav_sync_tokens`.

  The tier is chosen from what the server *advertises*, and some servers
  advertise `sync-collection` and then refuse every REPORT that uses it. A
  refusal on any path therefore demotes the integration to the best tier that
  does not need the extension, so a lying server costs one request rather than
  every sync.
  The daily forced full fetch clears the stored tier, so detection runs again
  and a server that refused once because it was genuinely unwell gets its delta
  sync back within a day.

  ## Reporting rather than deciding

  Outcomes that need an operator- or owner-facing decision are *reported*, not
  acted on here: `{:error, :unauthorized}`, `{:error, :forbidden}` and
  `{:error, :booking_calendar_missing}` all travel back to the caller. Whether
  those mean "flag the integration and stop retrying" or something else is a
  job-scheduling policy question, and lives with the Oban worker that asked for
  the sync.
