defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.OfflineQueue do
  @moduledoc """
  Replays locally-modified cache rows to the remote CalDAV server.

  Called at the start of every CalDAV sync cycle, **before** fetching
  remote changes. This ordering ensures local edits reach the server
  first so a subsequent pull cannot clobber them.

  ## Queue model

  Each row in `provider_calendar_events` carries a `sync_state` column
  set by the code that writes the row:

    * `"synced"`           — no pending work, skipped by the flush
    * `"locally_created"`  — PUT with `If-None-Match: *`
    * `"locally_modified"` — PUT with `If-Match: <cached etag>`
    * `"locally_deleted"`  — DELETE

  ## Success / failure

  On success the row is marked `"synced"` (or the cache row is deleted
  for a successful `locally_deleted`). On failure the row stays in the
  queue with an incremented `sync_attempts` and a human-readable
  description of the failure in `sync_last_error`. The next sync cycle
  retries automatically — there is no backoff beyond the sync cadence
  itself.

  A `412 Precondition Failed` response to a `locally_modified` flush
  follows the usual conflict-resolution policy (`:keep_local` for
  Tymeslot-owned events, `:fail` otherwise — the default is configured
  per row via `conflict_policy_for/1`).

  A `locally_modified` flush that finds no resource at all is the one case
  the policies cannot express, since none of them has a server copy to
  reconcile against. When a meeting that still expects its calendar event
  claims the row, the queue creates the event instead; see
  `recreate_missing/5`.

  ## Rows that belong to a repeating series

  An update or delete of a row that belongs to a series is never sent. A
  CalDAV series lives in one resource, so the write for any one occurrence
  lands on all of them: an update is patched onto the master VEVENT and a
  delete removes the resource. The grid refuses both before anything is
  queued (`Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEdit.ensure_editable/1`,
  `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventDeletion.ensure_deletable/1`), but a row queued
  before those guards existed still reaches the queue, and replaying it would
  change or remove a series nobody asked to touch.

  Such a row is skipped like any other that no retry can make sendable: it
  stays queued with a sentence in `sync_last_error`, and every cycle logs its
  uid, so the local change stays inspectable and nothing reaches the server.
  A `locally_created` row is not checked: a new series is written as one
  resource, which is what the create means.

  #
  # Two guards decide whether that repair is right.

  # cached row whose event has vanished from the fetch window, so the row is
  # dropped the same way here. This is also what clears rows queued before a
  # missing resource was handled at all: those had retried every cycle and
  # were, by construction, the ones outside the window.
  #
  # A live event is recreated only when a meeting that still expects its
  # calendar event claims the row. The `created_by_tymeslot` flag cannot gate
  # this: `QueueWiring.tag/3` stamps it on every write it queues, including an
  # organiser's grid edit of an event Tymeslot never created, so recreating on
  # the flag would resurrect somebody else's deletion. Resolving against the
  # meeting itself is the rule the grid and the reconciler already use. A
