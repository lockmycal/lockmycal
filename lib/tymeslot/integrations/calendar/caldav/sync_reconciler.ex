defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.SyncReconciler do
  @moduledoc """
  Deletion reconciliation and event processing for CalDAV sync workers.

  Handles three concerns that sit between raw CalDAV protocol operations and
  the provider-agnostic `Sync` module:

  1. **Safe event processing** — normalises raw CalDAV events, persists them
     via `Sync.persist_normalised_events/2`, and processes any deletion hrefs
     from a Tier 1 sync-collection response.

  2. **Href-based deletions** (Tier 1) — processes explicit deletion signals
     from sync-collection responses where the server reports removed resources
     by href.

  3. **UID-based deletion detection** (Tier 2/3 full fetch) — compares
     fetched event UIDs against the local cache to identify events that have
     disappeared from the server within the sync time window.

  ## Atomicity

  `process_full_fetch/6` and `process_tier1/3` wrap the cache-level writes
  (upsert + delete) in a single `Repo.transaction`. A crash, exception, or
  error return mid-way rolls the whole batch back, so the cache can never
  observe a partial sync.

  Meeting-level reconciliation (`Sync.reconcile/4`) and PubSub broadcasts
  run **outside** the transaction, because they have observable side
  effects (emails, cancellation workflows) that must not be rolled back.
  The transaction returns the list of actions to run post-commit; those
  actions are then executed best-effort.

  Atomically reconciles a Tier 2/3 full-fetch response.

  Wraps cache upsert AND deletion detection in a single `Repo.transaction`:

  1. Normalises raw events
  2. Upserts the batch (inside tx)
  3. Reads cached UIDs in the sync window (inside tx)
  4. Deletes cache rows for UIDs missing from the server response (inside tx)
  5. Commits
  6. Post-commit: broadcasts, runs meeting-time-change reconciliation,
     runs deletion reconciliation (may send emails; must not roll back)

  Returns `:ok` on success. On `{:error, reason}` the transaction has
  already rolled back — the cache is untouched and no side effects fire.

  # Deletion circuit breaker
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # A full-fetch listing implies deletions by *absence*: any cached UID the
  # server no longer returns is treated as deleted, which feeds
  # `apply_external_calendar_change(:deleted)` — auto-cancelling the linked
  # meeting and emailing both parties. That inference is only sound when the
  # listing is authoritative. A syntactically valid but empty response, or a
  # batch where every event failed to parse and was silently dropped, both
  # arrive here as "the server returned (almost) nothing" and would classify
  # the entire cache as stale — the one non-self-healing damage path in the
  # sync stack.
  #
  # A deletion batch looks suspicious when either the remote set is empty while
  # the cache is not (the strongest failed-read signal, applied at any cache
  # size), or a non-trivial cache would lose more than
  # `@bulk_delete_ratio_threshold` of its rows in a single sync.
  #
  # Suspicion alone cannot refuse forever, though. A failed read and a calendar
  # the user genuinely emptied produce the *same* listing, so "wait for a later
  # healthy fetch" never resolves the second case: the refusal blocks the sync
  # token, the next cycle re-fetches the same empty listing, and the integration
  # deadlocks. What separates the two is persistence over time — a transient
  # read failure does not survive dozens of cycles. `synced_at` on the cached
  # row is frozen at the last fetch that returned the event, so it already
  # measures exactly that, with no extra state to store.
  #
  # So: refuse a suspicious batch only while its rows are still recent. Once
  # every missing row has gone unconfirmed for `@bulk_delete_grace_hours`, the
  # absence is treated as real and the deletions are reconciled. Ordinary small
  # deletions stay below the threshold and are never delayed.
