  @moduledoc """
  Persistence of a CalDAV integration's sync bookkeeping.

  Three columns record where a sync got to: `caldav_sync_tokens` (per
  calendar path, a `DAV:sync-token` on Tier 1 or a `getctag` value on Tier 2),
  `caldav_sync_tier`, and the `last_external_sync_at` / `last_full_sync_at`
  timestamps.

  Every write here is best-effort. Losing a bookkeeping write costs at most one
  redundant full fetch on the next cycle, whereas failing the job would discard
  event data that has already been reconciled into the database. So a failed
  update logs and reports success; only the *event* write path can fail a sync.

  Records the detected sync tier and returns the updated integration.

  Tier detection is one-shot, so the caller needs the updated struct to sync
  with in the same run. If the write fails the tier is still applied in memory:
  the detection already happened and re-probing within the same run would be
  wasted work.

  Stamps the sync as having completed, optionally updating tracking columns.

  `last_external_sync_at` is always refreshed. The recognised options are
  `:sync_token`, `:clear_sync_tokens`, `:last_full_sync_at` and `:sync_tier`;
  an option that is absent leaves its column untouched, which is how a Tier 1
  failure keeps the previous sync token rather than advancing past changes it
  never applied.

  `:sync_token` is a `{calendar_path, token}` pair, and a `nil` token forgets
  that path's token. `clear_sync_tokens: true` forgets every path's at once.

  This records bookkeeping and nothing else. It used to clear the integration's
  health streak too, which looked equivalent and was not: it runs per path and
  per tier step rather than once per job, so on a multi-calendar integration a
  first calendar syncing normally cleared the streak that a second calendar's
  repeated failure had just added, and the badge could never reach the
  threshold that raises it. `SyncCalDavCalendarWorker` owns that signal now,
  at the job boundary, where every other provider's worker already puts it.
