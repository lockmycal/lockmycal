defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Sync.EventFetch do
  @moduledoc """
  Fetches a window of events from CalDAV calendar paths and reconciles the
  result, including paths that have disappeared from the server.

  This is the path every sync tier eventually funnels into: Tier 3 uses it
  directly, Tier 2 falls back to it for a calendar whose CTag moved, and Tier 1
  for a calendar whose sync token expired or whose delta came without event
  data. Every tier walks the configured paths through `each_path/3`, so a
  missing calendar is handled the same way whichever tier found it.

  ## Missing paths

  A 404 on a calendar path is ambiguous, so the two cases are separated
  deliberately. The *booking* calendar (the first configured path) disappearing
  needs the account owner to pick a different one, so it surfaces as
  `:booking_calendar_missing`. Any other path disappearing is routine — the
  owner deleted a calendar they had merely subscribed to — and is handled by
  dropping it from the integration so it is not re-fetched, and re-404ed, on
  every subsequent sweep.

  404s across all paths so the missing-path decision is made once with the

  Fetches and reconciles a single calendar path.

  Returns the bare `:not_found` sentinel when the collection is missing, for
  `each_path/3` to decide between dropping the path and flagging the
  integration.

  Options:

    * `:new_ctag` — a `getctag` value (Tier 2) to store as the path's sync
      token once the events have been reconciled.
    * `:new_sync_token` — a `DAV:sync-token` (Tier 1) to store the same way.

  Either is written only on success: a failed reconciliation must not advance
  the token past changes it never applied.
