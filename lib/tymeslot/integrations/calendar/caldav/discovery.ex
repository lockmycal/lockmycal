defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Discovery do
  @moduledoc """
  CalDAV server and calendar discovery domain.

  Owns the RFC 4791 principal-chasing protocol that locates a user's calendar
  collection on any compliant server — including those where the guessed
  discovery path fails. Also validates URLs for SSRF safety and rate-limits
  discovery operations before any network contact.

  ## Discovery Strategy

  1. Attempts the provider-specific guessed path (e.g., `/calendars/{user}/`).
  2. On `:not_found`, `:forbidden`, `:method_not_allowed` or `:server_error`,
     follows the full RFC 4791 chain:
     - PROPFIND the supplied base URL, then the origin root, until one answers
       with a `current-user-principal` href
     - PROPFIND principal URL → `calendar-home-set` href
     - PROPFIND calendar-home-set → calendar list

  Callers receive `CalendarEntry` structs — never raw HTTP responses, XML, or
  intermediate maps.

  # `:method_not_allowed` belongs here for the same reason `:not_found` does:
  # a 405 is what a PROPFIND draws at a URL that exists but is not DAV-mounted
  # (a service root, or a reverse proxy answering unknown methods itself), so
  # the address was wrong rather than the credentials.
  #
  # Everything else ends the walk where it stands. `:unauthorized` in
  # particular must not advance: the credentials are wrong, no URL can fix
  # that, and re-presenting a rejected login to a server that locks accounts
  # out makes the user's situation worse rather than better.

  # Discover/Test any more than they can save such a URL. Plain HTTP for public
  # hosts is still rejected via `enforce_https_for_public`, except for a host on
  # an internal name once private addresses are allowed.
  #
  # `opts[:allow_private_ips]` lets a trusted in-process caller (e.g. the live
  # CalDAV integration test against a local Baikal container) bypass the
  # private-IP block. It otherwise defaults to the operator's
  # `ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS_FOR_CALENDAR` opt-out (false in production), so every
  # request originating from a user-supplied URL — the only path that matters
  # for SSRF — keeps the same posture as persistence.
