defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.Provider do
  @moduledoc """
  Microsoft Exchange calendar provider, speaking EWS.

  Reads busy time and calendar items, and writes confirmed bookings back
  through `Exchange.Writes` (`CreateItem`, `UpdateItem`, `DeleteItem`). It was
  read-only until the write path landed, and nothing in this module should
  still say otherwise.

  Targets **on-premises** Exchange Server (2016, 2019, SE). Exchange Online is
  served by the `:outlook` provider over Microsoft Graph instead, and its EWS
  endpoint is being retired by Microsoft, so this provider must never be
  offered as a route to a Microsoft 365 mailbox.

  ## Why this is its own family

  EWS is neither CalDAV nor OAuth: it is SOAP over HTTPS with credentials, so
  it builds on neither `CaldavCommon` nor `OAuthBase` and implements the
  `Provider` behaviour directly, as `Ics.Provider` does.

  ## Two live reads, with different jobs

  A sync window costs two independent EWS reads, and neither subsumes the
  other. **Neither is a `Provider` callback and neither is named like one**:
  both are called only by `Tymeslot.Workers.SyncExchangeCalendarWorker`, and
  the names say so on purpose (see the next section).

    * `list_busy_intervals/2` asks `GetUserAvailability` when the mailbox is
      busy. It is the source of truth for availability, and its intervals are
      cached as `busy_only` rows.
    * `list_calendar_items/2` asks `FindItem` over a `CalendarView` for the
      ids in range, then one batched `GetItem` for their fields. It answers
      *what* each event is: identity, subject, location, change key, which is
      what the dashboard grid renders, and its items are cached as
      `display_only` rows. `item_client_configs/1` builds the one client per
      selected folder that read fans out over.

  The split exists because the item path cannot see a recurring series. A
  server was observed answering a `CalendarView` with a single
  `RecurringMaster` dated to the first occurrence, and with nothing at all for
  a window covering later ones, so an organiser booked every morning reads as
  free from the second day on. `GetUserAvailability` expands the series
  server-side. It answers no item identity in return — no id, no subject, no
  change key — which is why it cannot simply replace the item path.

  Availability must therefore never be served from the items, and the two
  lists must never be merged: they are different populations, and the item one
  is known to be short.

  `list_calendar_items/2` costs two round trips per window however many events
  fall in it, because `GetItem` accepts every id at once. `FindItem` is used
  purely to enumerate: it cannot return an item's iCalendar `UID` — the
  property is silently dropped rather than faulted — and a cached event needs
  a stable uid.

  ## `list_events/2` reads the cache, never the network

  The `Provider` callback is neither of those reads, and that is the whole
  point of naming them apart. The availability path
  (`Runtime.EventQueries.fetch_events_from_providers/3` →
  `EventsRead.fetch_events_with_fallback/3` → `ProviderAdapter.get_events/3` →
  `list_events/2`) runs on every booking page load, fans out over every client
  the organiser has, and fails closed if any one of them fails. Answering it
  from EWS would put a credentialed SOAP round trip on that page and hand an
  on-premises server's downtime the power to close the organiser's diary. It
  would also serve availability from the item path, which the section above
  says must never happen. `Ics.Provider` documents the same trap and solves it
  the same way.

  So `list_events/2` reads the local event cache the sync worker last wrote,
  under the availability path's own role filter: `display_only` rows are
  excluded, so an Exchange integration serves its `busy_only` intervals and
  never its known-incomplete item rows.

  A client naming no integration is an error rather than an empty list. This
  is the one place this provider deliberately departs from `Ics.Provider`,
  which answers `{:ok, []}`: here `{:ok, []}` would report the mailbox as free
  for the whole window under a success, which is the worst answer this
  provider can give and the same reasoning that makes
  `{:error, :no_mailbox_address}` an error in `list_busy_intervals/2`.

  ## Availability is whole-mailbox

  `GetUserAvailability` addresses a *mailbox*, not a folder, so selecting a
  subset of calendars does not narrow the busy time it reports. This is a real
  behavioural difference from every other provider and belongs in the
  connection UI's copy, not only here. It is also why the operation needs an
  address where the folder-scoped calls need only a login; see `mailbox/1`.

  ## Writing back is a third operation set

  The three write callbacks issue `CreateItem`, `UpdateItem` and `DeleteItem`
  through `Exchange.Writes`, which owns the request shapes and the error
  vocabulary. An Exchange calendar is therefore a booking target like any
  other: `build_booking_client_config/1` resolves one, and
  `ProviderConfig.read_only?/1` no longer names this provider.

  A written item is addressed afterwards by the **item id the server assigned**,
  never by a uid Tymeslot chose: EWS ignores a `t:UID` sent on create. So
  `create_event/2` answers a `CreatedEvent` carrying that id as its
  `provider_event_id` and no iCalendar uid at all, which
  `Meetings.CalendarEventSync` persists as the meeting's `provider_event_id`
  and hands back to `update_event/3` and `delete_event/3`.

  Writing does not change where availability comes from. A booking written
  here is read back by `GetUserAvailability` on the next sync like any other
  item in the mailbox, so nothing about the busy-time path needs to know a
  write happened.

  A **live** EWS read, called only by

  the `busy_only` rows `list_events/2` then serves. It is the source of truth
  for availability, and the only read that sees every occurrence
  of a recurring series. It answers plain maps carrying bounds and a busy
  type, never `CalendarEvent` structs: `GetUserAvailability` returns no item
  identity at all, so the intervals cannot be correlated back to the meetings
  that produced them.

  `{:error, :no_mailbox_address}` when the integration names no address the
  operation can be addressed to. Answering `{:ok, []}` there would report the
  mailbox as free for the whole window under a success, which is the worst
  answer this provider can give and the one failure it must never degrade
  into; the same reasoning is why an unreadable response is an error inside
  `Exchange.FreeBusy` rather than an empty list.

  ## The window is read in slices

  One request cannot carry the sync window: the Availability service refuses a
  `TimeWindow` longer than `@availability_chunk_days` (see the attribute for
  the limit and why it is set where it is). The requested range is therefore
  sliced into consecutive requests that tile it exactly, from the caller's
  start to the caller's end, and their intervals are concatenated in order.
  The window a caller asks for is still the window read, so a caller pairing
  these bounds with a cache query over the same bounds stays consistent.

  The first slice that fails ends the read with its own error term, exactly as
  the single request it replaced did. A partial answer is never returned: half
  a mailbox's busy time is a diary that reads as free for the rest of the
  year, which is the failure this provider is built around.

  Intervals are handed back as the server sent them, with no merging across
  slice boundaries. A busy period spanning one is clipped by the server to
  each side, so it arrives as two adjacent intervals, and two adjacent rows
  block precisely what one row spanning both would: nothing downstream reasons
  about an interval's identity, or about how many of them cover a stretch. An
  exact duplicate, were a server to answer one unclipped on both sides, is
  collapsed on the way into the cache, since `IntervalNormaliser` derives the
  uid from the bounds and the busy type and
  `ProviderCalendarEventQueries.upsert_batch/1` keeps one entry per uid.
