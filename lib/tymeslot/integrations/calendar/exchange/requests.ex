defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.Requests do
  @moduledoc """
  Builders for the EWS request bodies this provider issues.

  Each function returns the operation element only; wrapping it in a SOAP
  envelope is `Exchange.Soap.envelope/1`'s job.

  ## Why the read path is two calls

  `FindItem` cannot return an item's iCalendar `UID`: the property is silently
  dropped from `AdditionalProperties` rather than faulted, which was confirmed
  against a live server. `CalendarEvent` requires a stable non-empty `uid`, so
  `FindItem` is used purely to enumerate item ids over a `CalendarView`, and a
  single batched `GetItem` fetches the fields. `GetItem` accepts many ids and
  answers one response message per id, so the cost is two round trips per sync
  window regardless of how many events fall in it.

  `IncludeMimeContent` is deliberately never requested. It returns a base64
  MIME multipart message whose `text/calendar` part is quoted-printable
  encoded, so reaching the iCalendar inside costs a MIME parse and a QP decode
  to obtain fields that `BaseShape=Default` already returns as typed XML.

  ## Busy time comes from a different operation

  `FindItem` over a `CalendarView` does not expand a recurring series on every
  server. A grommunio mailbox answers one `RecurringMaster` dated to the
  series' first occurrence, and nothing at all for a window covering later
  ones, so the item path cannot see the third week of a weekly standup.
  `get_user_availability/3` is the operation that does expand it, and
  `Exchange.FreeBusy` reads its answer; the item path feeds the dashboard grid
  rather than availability.

  ## The write path addresses items by id, never by uid

  EWS assigns a calendar item's iCalendar `UID` itself, and a `t:UID` sent on
  `CreateItem` is ignored; that was verified against a live server. So a write
  cannot choose the handle it will use later. `create_item/2` answers the
  server's `ItemId`, which the provider hands back as the created event's `id`
  and which `Meetings.CalendarEventSync` persists as `provider_event_id`;
  `update_item/2` and `delete_item/1` take that id back.

  The change key is deliberately never sent. `UpdateItem` and `DeleteItem`
  naming an `ItemId` with no `ChangeKey` act on the item's current version,
  and the id itself survives an update unchanged, both verified against a live
  server. Threading a version stamp through would cost a `GetItem` before every
  write to refresh it, and buy a conflict check no caller here can act on: a
  booking write-back is the authority on the meeting it describes.

  ## Writes never invite anyone

  Every write carries `SendMeetingInvitations="SendToNone"` (or the
  cancellation equivalent) and no attendee elements at all. Tymeslot sends its
  own invitation and cancellation emails, so an item carrying attendees would
  have the Exchange server mail the same people a second time. This is the same
  trap `CalendarEventBuilder` documents for CalDAV, where the defence is
  `SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT` on the `ORGANIZER` line; here it is an item with no
  attendees on it. The attendee's name and address still reach the organiser's
  diary, in the description `CalendarEventBuilder` assembles.

  ## Paging is not implemented

  Neither builder requests an indexed page view, so `FindItem` returns at most
  the server's `FindCountLimit` worth of items and truncates the rest. Nothing
  reads `IncludesLastItemInRange` either, so a folder or sync window larger
  than that limit is silently short rather than an error: the response carries
  `IncludesLastItemInRange="false"` and the events past the cut simply never
  reach the caller. Paging is deliberately left out of this phase; adding it
  means an `m:IndexedPageItemView` on `find_item/3` and a loop driven by that
  attribute.

  Fetches the given items in one request.

  Takes `{item_id, change_key}` pairs as returned by `FindItem`, and requires

  to render: `m:ItemIds` demands a child, so the server would answer a schema
  fault to a request that could only ever have returned nothing. Callers skip
  the operation when the window is empty, and the guard makes forgetting that
  fail here rather than a round trip later.

  Two properties are asked for on top of `BaseShape=Default`, which returns
  neither: `calendar:IsCancelled`, so a cancelled meeting stops blocking the
  organiser's diary, and `calendar:StartTimeZone`, which is the only exact way
  to recover an all-day event's own calendar day. Asking is free against a
  server that does not implement them. Unsupported properties are dropped from
  the response rather than faulted, which was confirmed against a live
  grommunio server: it answers `NoError` and simply omits both elements, while
  a real Exchange server answers them. The normaliser therefore treats both as
  optional and gains correctness wherever they arrive.

  Asks for one mailbox's busy intervals over a window.

  `GetUserAvailability` is the only EWS operation that expands a recurring
  series, so it is what decides busy time; `Exchange.FreeBusy` parses the
  answer.

  The `t:TimeZone` block is not decoration. Omitting it, or sending a partial
  one, makes the server answer an empty body carrying no fault and no response
  code, which is indistinguishable from a free calendar unless the reader
  refuses to read it as one. A bias of zero with placeholder standard and
  daylight rules puts that zone on UTC, which is what the window boundaries
  below are shifted into and what the answer comes back in.

  `FreeBusy` is the view asked for rather than `Detailed`. The two return the
  same intervals with the same busy types, verified against a live server, and
  the server downgrades a `Detailed` request to `FreeBusy` anyway. `Detailed`
  differs only in asking a permissioned server for the meeting subjects,
  locations and item ids that `Exchange.FreeBusy` discards, so it costs
  mailbox content for nothing.

  `t:MergedFreeBusyIntervalInMinutes` is inert for that view: it sizes the
  merged bitmask only a `MergedOnly` view returns. It stays because the
  request verified against a live server carried it, and a schema deviation
  here is answered with an empty body and no fault, which is indistinguishable
  from a free calendar; trading a verified request for an unverified one to
  save a line is a bad bet.
