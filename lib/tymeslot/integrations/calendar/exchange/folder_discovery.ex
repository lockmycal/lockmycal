defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.FolderDiscovery do
  @moduledoc """
  Turns a `FindFolder` response into `CalendarEntry` structs.

  A `Deep` traversal from `msgfolderroot` returns every folder in the mailbox,
  so calendars are picked out by element name (`t:CalendarFolder`) rather than
  by guessing from the display name. Every property except the folder id is
  treated as optional, for the reason `Exchange.EventNormaliser` documents: a
  live server drops properties it does not implement rather than faulting, so
  a missing element carries no signal about the request.

  ## A failed response message fails the call

  `Requests.find_folder/0` names one parent folder and so gets one response
  message back. Skipping a message that did not succeed would answer
  `{:ok, []}` for a mailbox that could not be enumerated at all, which the
  caller cannot tell apart from a mailbox holding no calendars and would
  persist as an emptied calendar list. `Soap.require_success/2` surfaces the
  response code instead, so the failure stays visible and callers can map it
  (`ErrorAccessDenied` and `ErrorNonExistentMailbox` being the ones an
  operator actually hits).

  ## Entries are not flagged read-only

  `read_only: true` means "the server says this calendar cannot be written".
  `FindFolder` with the `Default` folder shape reports no rights at all, so
  setting the flag would be asserting something the server never stated. That
  this phase writes nothing is a property of the provider, not of the folder,
  and is enforced where the write path is offered rather than here.

  # A FindFolder response carries no marker for the mailbox's default
  # calendar: `DistinguishedFolderId` is a request-only element, and the
  # Default folder shape returns nothing else that singles one out. Short of a
  # second round trip (a `GetFolder` on `DistinguishedFolderId Id="calendar"`,
  # whose folder id could then be matched against these), the display name is
  # the only signal, and Exchange localises it: a German mailbox names its
  # default calendar "Kalender". A mailbox holding exactly one calendar folder
  # therefore needs no name match at all, since the default calendar cannot be
  # deleted and so must be that folder. Anything else leaves no primary, which
  # callers already treat as "unknown" rather than as a confirmed negative.
