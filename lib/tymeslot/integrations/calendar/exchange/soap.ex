defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.Soap do
  @moduledoc """
  SOAP envelope construction and response parsing for EWS.

  Deliberately free of EWS domain knowledge: it wraps a body, parses a
  response, surfaces SOAP faults, and hands back response-message elements.
  Which operations exist and what their payloads mean belongs to
  `Exchange.Requests` and the normaliser modules.

  The XML on this path comes from a server the user nominated, so it is not
  trusted input. Parsing therefore runs with `dtd: :none`, which refuses to
  fetch an external DTD (xmerl would otherwise resolve a `SYSTEM` identifier
  in a `DOCTYPE`), and with namespace conformance on. Entity declarations are
  refused by xmerl itself, so no expansion is possible either way.

  Unlike `CalDAV.XmlHandler`, this module applies no size cap of its own. EWS
  bodies reach it through `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.HTTPClient`, which streams
  every response through a byte budget (`:max_response_bytes`) and aborts the
  transfer once it is exceeded, so the size bound is already enforced at the
  transport layer.

  Callers extract values with `xpath/2,3` here rather than with
  `SweetXml.xpath/2,3`, because this one binds the `t:`, `m:` and `s:`
  prefixes onto the expression and onto every subspec. SweetXml offers no
  document-level namespace option: bindings live on the expression itself, and
  each subspec carries its own, so an unbound prefix in a nested extraction
  yields `""` rather than an error.

  is a typed error rather than an exception.

  A body that is not XML at all is logged as an anomaly. Pass `log: false`
  where it is not one: a caller that classifies the response by its HTTP status

  the account owner can act on.

  place instead of once per call site.

  The spec is read as a string whatever cast modifier it carries, so
  `~x"./t:UID/text()"` and `~x"./t:UID/text()"s` behave alike. SweetXml's `so`
  modifier is not a substitute: it answers `""` for a missing element too.

  A spec that can match more than one node needs care: casting a nodeset to a
  string concatenates every match, so a document-wide
  `//m:ResponseCode/text()` over two response messages answers
  `"NoErrorErrorAccessDenied"` rather than either code. The relative reads on
