defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.ItemCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Keeps the Exchange item cache — the `display_only` rows the dashboard grid
  renders — up to date from a folder's `SyncFolderItems` change feed.

  The incremental half of `Tymeslot.Workers.SyncExchangeCalendarWorker`'s item
  read, extracted from it because it is a different job with different state:
  the worker owns the cycle, its two halves and their outcomes, while this owns
  the per-folder tokens and what a feed's changes mean for cached rows. The
  worker still owns the full windowed read, because that read is also what
  runs when this one cannot.

  ## What a change means for the cache

  A `Create` or `Update` is an item to fetch, normalise and upsert. A `Delete`
  is a row to remove by `provider_event_id`. The third case has no counterpart
  in the feed at all: an item whose new dates put it **outside** the sync
  window is fetched like any other change and then deleted, because the feed
  cannot distinguish an item that moved away from one that was removed, and a
  cached row for an item no longer in the window is a row the grid would show
  in the wrong place.

  ## Tokens are per folder, and stored together

  `SyncFolderItems` is folder-scoped, so each selected folder keeps its own
  token, and they live together in `calendar_integrations.exchange_sync_states`
  keyed by folder id. Writes merge rather than replace, and prune the keys of
  folders no longer selected: a token left behind for a deselected folder would
  be replayed months later if that folder came back, against a feed the server
  has long since moved past.

  ## Nothing here decides freshness

  Whether a cycle may run incrementally at all is `full_sync_due?/1`'s answer
  and the worker's decision. This module never performs a full read on its own:
  a failure is reported, the tokens are left where they were, and the next
  cycle decides again with the same rule.

  The one exception is a token the server refuses outright
  (`ItemSync.invalid_sync_state?/1`). That folder's token is dropped and the
  worker is *asked* for a full read through `{:error, :full_sync_required,
  integration}`; the read itself still belongs to the worker. Without it the
  folder is stuck for good: the refusal repeats every cycle, the sweep
  re-enqueues it because `last_external_sync_at` never advances, and the
  availability half is re-read in full each time for a grid half that can
  never succeed.

  Applies every folder's changes since its stored token, and answers the uids

  The first folder to fail ends the refresh with its error and no token is

  acknowledging a partial one.

  A folder whose token the server refuses is the one failure this recovers
  from rather than reports. Its token is dropped and the answer is
  `{:error, :full_sync_required, integration}`, carrying the integration with
  that token already gone: the caller's full read then re-bootstraps it, where
  reporting the refusal would have every later cycle replay the same spent
  token.
