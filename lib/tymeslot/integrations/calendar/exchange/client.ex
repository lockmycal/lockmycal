defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  EWS transport.

  The only module in the Exchange stack that communicates with the HTTP
  client; everything above it works with parsed documents and typed errors
  rather than `Req.Response` structs, mirroring the boundary
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.Http` draws. The error vocabulary is
  that module's too, so a status can only mean one thing across the two
  families and the sync layer needs no per-provider dialect.

  EWS answers a SOAP fault with HTTP 500 as a matter of course (a malformed
  request body produces exactly that), so a 500 is parsed for a fault before
  it is treated as a server error. A fault can also arrive with HTTP 200, so
  every parsed body is checked for one either way.

  Credentials never reach an error term or a log line: the Basic
  authorization header is built here and nothing that carries it is logged,
  and the endpoint is logged as scheme and host only, which drops any userinfo
  a base URL might carry.

  ## Every request passes through a circuit breaker

  This is the one place an EWS request is issued, so it is the one place the
  breaker has to be applied; a seam higher up would leave whichever operation
  forgot to use it hammering a dead server. The CalDAV family wraps at its
  operation modules only because it needs an opt-out for the offline queue's
  replay, and nothing here has an equivalent.

  The breaker is keyed by **host**, not by provider, exactly as the CalDAV
  family keys its own. Exchange is self-hosted, so one organiser's unreachable
  server says nothing about anyone else's, and a provider-wide breaker would
  let a single broken deployment stop every Exchange sync on the node.

  Which failures count is `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.BreakerOutcome`'s decision
  rather than this module's, and the split falls where the error vocabulary
  above already puts it: `:timeout`, `:network_error`, `:rate_limited` and
  `:server_error` say the server is unwell and trip the breaker, while
  `:unauthorized`, `:forbidden`, `:not_found`, `:tls_error`, a
  `{:soap_fault, _}` and an `{:unexpected_status, _}` describe one
  integration's credentials, endpoint or request and leave breaker state
  untouched. Tripping a shared breaker on those would let one organiser's
  wrong password stop the syncs of everyone else on the same server.
