defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.Creation do
  @moduledoc """
  Validates and creates an Exchange (EWS) calendar integration.

  A sibling of `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Creation` rather than another
  branch inside it, for the same reason the subscription path is separate: an
  EWS integration is not CalDAV-shaped. It has no `calendar_paths` — an
  Exchange folder is named by the opaque `FolderId` the server issues — and it
  carries two fields the CalDAV attrs do not: `provider_account_email`, the
  mailbox `GetUserAvailability` is addressed to, and `verify_ssl`, which an
  on-premises server behind a self-signed certificate needs.

  Discovered folders are persisted writable, which is the same thing
  `Exchange.FolderDiscovery` says by declining to set `read_only` at all:
  `FindFolder` reports no rights, so a flag either way would assert something
  the server never said. They were forced `read_only: true` here while the
  provider refused every write, to keep such a folder out of the booking-target
  pickers; the write path now exists, so the override is gone and the flag is
  back to meaning only what a server states.

  What the server does not state is still not known here. A folder the account
  can read but not write is offered as a booking target like any other, and the
  refusal arrives when the first booking is written to it. `FindFolder` gives
  nothing better to go on, and a folder-by-folder rights probe at connection
  time would cost a round trip each to answer a question that changes without
  notice anyway.

  Reads the connection form's TLS-verification checkbox.

  Public because the form's two steps both need the answer and must not
  disagree: discovery runs before this module does, and has to hand the same
  setting to the transport that the row will later carry.

  An unchecked HTML checkbox submits nothing at all, so an absent key means
  "unticked" rather than "not asked". The form pairs the checkbox with a hidden
  `"false"` so the two cases cannot be confused, but the absent case is handled
  here rather than trusted to the markup.
