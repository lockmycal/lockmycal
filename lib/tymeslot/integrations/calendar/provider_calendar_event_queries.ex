  @doc """
  Returns all cached events for the given integration IDs within a time range.

  Events are included if they overlap with the [range_start, range_end] window.
  Both timed events (start_at/end_at) and all-day events (start_date/end_date)
  are checked for overlap. Results are ordered by start time ascending.

  This is the **display** read: it feeds the dashboard grid, the reminder
  scan and the cache-population guards, so `busy_only` rows are excluded.
  Those rows are opaque busy time carrying no identity — no subject, no
  location, no provider event id — and rendering one would put a nameless
  block on the grid next to the item row describing the very same meeting.
  Availability reads `CalendarEventQueries.in_range/2` instead, which excludes
  the other side. Every provider but Exchange writes only `both` rows, so
  neither filter changes what they return.

  A row the organiser has deleted is also excluded, even while the delete is
  still queued for the server: the flash says the event is gone and will be
  retried, so leaving it drawn contradicts it. Availability deliberately keeps
  counting the row until the delete lands, because the event is still on the
  server and the slot is not free yet. This used to happen by accident — the
  queue tag blanked the timing columns the overlap test reads — and stopped
  the moment that blanking was fixed.

  ## Options

  - `:limit` — maximum number of rows to return (default: unbounded). Since
    results are ordered ascending by start time, the earliest-starting events
    in the range are the ones kept when a limit is applied.

  # Fields updated on conflict — everything except the surrogate key, inserted_at,
  # the identity fields :provider and :provider_calendar_id (set at insert time from
  # the integration and must never be overwritten with EXCLUDED values from partial
  # cache-update maps that may omit them), Tymeslot-owned fields that are written
  # independently of provider data (:ical_sequence, :last_notified_state,
  # :video_link, :video_integration_id), and the offline write queue columns
  # (:sync_state, :sync_attempts, :sync_last_attempt_at, :sync_last_error) which
  # must survive a server-sourced upsert so OfflineQueue can still replay the
  # local change after the cache row has been refreshed.
  #
  # :created_by_tymeslot is excluded so a sync can never clear it: the ownership
  # lookup can miss (a meeting outside the queried window), and that false must
  # not retract the flag `CalDAV.QueueWiring` raised when Tymeslot wrote the
  # event. `raise_tymeslot_ownership/1` supplies the raising half.
  #
  # :role is excluded for the same reason as :provider — it is insert-time
  # identity. A row does not change from a busy interval into a calendar item,
  # and a partial cache update that omits it must not silently re-file the row
  # as the default. Its absence here is a decision, not an oversight.
  #
  # The field now exists on the schema and `full_refresh_for_role/3` writes it,
  # so its absence from this list is what keeps it insert-time identity: a
  # server-sourced upsert that omits `:role` (every provider but Exchange does)
  # cannot re-file an existing row, and one that supplies it cannot move a row
  # from one read path to the other.
  @doc """
  The columns a server-sourced upsert is allowed to overwrite on an existing
  row. Public because `CalDAV.QueueQueries` extends it for a queue entry, which
  declares a new *local* intent and so may write the bookkeeping columns this
  list withholds. Nothing else should need it.
