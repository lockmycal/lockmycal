defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.ICalBuilder.Series.Split do
  @moduledoc """
  Splitting a recurring event stored as one CalDAV resource in two at one of
  its occurrences, for an edit of that occurrence and every one after it.
  The public entry points, and the rules they follow, are
  `ICalBuilder.Series.split/5` and `ICalBuilder.Series.truncate/3`; this
  module is their implementation.

  The split is made at the edited occurrence's slot, its original start on
  the wall clock of the series' zone (the occurrence key). Every value is
  compared with it on that wall clock, whatever form it is written in.

  The tail is a series whose first occurrence is the slot, so an edit of
  "this and every following occurrence" of the original is an edit of every
  occurrence of the tail. It is carried out by `Series.Master` on the tail
  alone, which moves the tail's exceptions, overrides and rule with it and
  refuses exactly the edits it refuses for the whole series.
