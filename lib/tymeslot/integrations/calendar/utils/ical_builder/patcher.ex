defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.ICalBuilder.Patcher do
  @moduledoc """
  Property-level patching of a stored iCalendar document.

  `ICalBuilder.build_simple_event/3` serialises the whole event from
  Tymeslot's payload, which is right for an event Tymeslot authored and wrong
  for one it merely synced: everything the payload does not model (`ATTENDEE`
  and its `PARTSTAT`/`ROLE`/`RSVP` parameters, `CATEGORIES`, `SEQUENCE`,
  `X-` properties, an `ORGANIZER` the server set) disappears from the
  organiser's calendar the moment the event is edited.

  This module rewrites only the properties the payload carries, in place, and
  leaves every other line of the document exactly as the server returned it.

  ## What is patched

  Each payload key owns one property (`:summary` → `SUMMARY`, `:start_time` →
  `DTSTART`, ...). A key the payload does not carry leaves its property alone;
  a key it carries with an empty value deletes the property, so clearing a
  field in the grid clears it on the server too. Reminders are the one
  subcomponent: supplying `:reminders` replaces the event's `VALARM` blocks,
  omitting the key keeps them.

  ## What is left alone

    * Components other than `VEVENT`. A `VTIMEZONE` carries its own `DTSTART`
      and `RRULE` for each `STANDARD`/`DAYLIGHT` subcomponent; patching those
      would corrupt the timezone definition.
    * `VEVENT`s carrying a `RECURRENCE-ID`. Those are overrides of single
      occurrences with their own timing; only the master event of the series
      is patched.
    * The attendee list, unless the payload carries `:attendees`. A payload
      without the key has no opinion about who the event is with, and every
      `ATTENDEE`, `CONTACT` and `X-TYMESLOT-ATTENDEES` line stays exactly as
      the server returned it.

  ## Attendees

  A payload that carries `:attendees` states the complete new list, so a
  guest removed in the grid is removed from the document too. It is merged
  into the stored `ATTENDEE` lines rather than written over them:

    * A guest who stays keeps their stored line verbatim, `PARTSTAT`, `ROLE`,
      `RSVP`, `CN` and `SCHEDULE-AGENT` included. The cached attendee map does
      not hold those parameters for CalDAV, so rebuilding the line from it
      would reset every reply, which is how the original full rewrite lost
      them.
    * A guest who is gone loses their line. Addresses are compared without
      regard to case, as the grid compares them.
    * A guest who is new is written the way the caller's `mode` says (see
      `CalDAV.Scheduling`): `ATTENDEE;SCHEDULE-AGENT=CLIENT` in `:attendee`
      mode, so the server stores them without mailing them, since Tymeslot
      sends its own invitation.
    * An `ATTENDEE` whose address is not a `mailto:` URI (a room, a group, a
      `urn:uuid:` principal) cannot be named by the payload's list, which the
      sync builds from `mailto:` addresses only, and is kept.
    * In `:organiser_attendee` mode the `ATTENDEE` naming the event's
      `ORGANIZER` is kept whatever the list says, and in Tymeslot's own block
      is added when missing: that server adds its calendar's owner back
      under their primary address the moment the line goes (issue #151).

  Tymeslot's own block, told apart by the `X-TYMESLOT-ATTENDEES` marker
  `build_simple_event/3` emits beside it or by the absence of any `ATTENDEE`
  at all, also has its `CONTACT` lines rewritten. In `:contact` mode such a
  block is rebuilt as `CONTACT` lines outright, so a document written under
  the other mode converges on the current one. A block the organiser's own
  client wrote keeps its `CONTACT` lines, and in `:contact` mode gains no new
  ones either: a `CONTACT` added to a document whose `CONTACT` lines this
  module does not own could never be taken away again.
