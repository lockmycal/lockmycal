defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.ICalBuilder do
  @moduledoc """
  Builds iCalendar (RFC 5545) formatted data for calendar events.

  This module provides functions to create, parse, and manipulate
  iCalendar data used by CalDAV and other calendar providers.

  ## Features
  - Event creation with all standard properties
  - Timezone support
  - Recurring event support
  - Attendee management
  - Alarm/reminder support

  ## Internal structure

  The builder is split into focused sibling modules; this module orchestrates
  them and exposes the public API:

    - `__MODULE__.Format` — date/time formatting, text escaping, UID generation
    - `__MODULE__.Properties` — canonical VEVENT property-line serialisers
    - `__MODULE__.Alarms` — VALARM (reminder) serialisation
    - `__MODULE__.LineFolder` — RFC 5545 §3.1 content-line folding
    - `__MODULE__.Patcher` — property-level patching of a stored document

  ## Building versus patching

  `build_simple_event/3` serialises a whole event from Tymeslot's payload and
  is the writer for an event Tymeslot authors. `patch_event_properties/3`
  rewrites named properties of a document the provider already holds and is
  the writer for an event that arrived by sync, where everything the payload
  does not model has to survive the write.

  @doc """
  Builds a minimal iCalendar document for quick event creation.

  Used for simple events without complex properties.

  Timed events are always serialised in UTC with a `Z` suffix — Tymeslot
  deliberately avoids TZID / VTIMEZONE emission because a spec-compliant
  VTIMEZONE body (RFC 5545 §3.6.5) requires authored STANDARD/DAYLIGHT
  subcomponents with real TZOFFSETFROM/TO and RRULE rules, which we don't
  generate from our tzdata-backed clock. Stricter CalDAV servers (Radicale's
  vobject) reject a VTIMEZONE without those subcomponents as HTTP 400. The
  UTC wall-clock is preserved correctly, and the per-user timezone label is
  reconstructed at display time from the user's profile timezone — the iCal
  payload never drives user-facing labels.

  The `mode` decides whether the attendee is advertised as a real `ATTENDEE`
  or as the `CONTACT` fallback; `CalDAV.Scheduling.attendee_mode/1` owns that
  choice per server. It defaults to `:contact`, the conservative answer, so a
  caller that has no client in hand cannot accidentally ask a scheduling-happy
  server to mail everyone.

  Applies the property changes `event_data` describes to an existing raw

  it. `ATTENDEE` blocks, `CATEGORIES`, `SEQUENCE`, `X-` properties and
  anything else Tymeslot does not model survive the write, which
  `build_simple_event/3` cannot promise: it serialises the payload and
