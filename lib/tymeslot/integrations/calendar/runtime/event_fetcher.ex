  Reads a user's events from their connected calendar providers.

  - List events across all calendars
  - Range fetches with request coalescing
  - Event filtering and deduplication

  Named a fetcher rather than a queries module because it performs no data
  access of its own: this is provider HTTP fan-out, metrics, and the
  fail-closed availability gate, on the live booking path. The `*_queries.ex`
  suffix would have exempted the whole file from `CredoChecks.RepoCallBoundary`
