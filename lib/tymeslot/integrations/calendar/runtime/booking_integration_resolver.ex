defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Runtime.BookingIntegrationResolver do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolves which calendar integration owns a booking, given a `Meeting`,
  `MeetingType`, `{integration_id, user_id}` tuple, or bare user id.

  The resolver implements a fallback chain:

  1. If the explicit context names an integration the user owns that can
     still take a booking, that integration is returned (with
     `default_booking_calendar_id` overridden by the context's stored value
     where applicable).
  2. Otherwise the user's primary calendar integration is used.
  3. If the primary has no booking calendar configured, the first
     integration with a booking calendar is used.
  4. Finally, any integration is used.

  Every tier applies the same test, `booking_target?/1`: the integration is
  active, its credentials have not been refused (`needs_reauth`), and its
  provider accepts writes. Read-only integrations (a subscribed feed) can
  block availability but can never receive a booking, so resolving one would
  hand the booking flow an integration that builds no client; see
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.BookingEligibility`. A flagged integration
  stays active so the dashboard, the health probe and the token refresh sweep
  keep seeing it, but every write against it fails, retries, and alerts the
  owner, while a working calendar sits unused.
