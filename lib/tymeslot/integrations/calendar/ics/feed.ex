  @moduledoc """
  Fetches and parses a published iCalendar feed.

  The network half of the `ics_url` provider, kept separate from
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Ics.Provider` because it is the only part
  that touches the outside world: the provider's own read path serves the
  local event cache, and only the sync worker and the connection test come
  through here.

  Feed URLs are supplied by the user and point at hosts we know nothing
  about, so every request is SSRF-guarded, capped in size, and limited to two
  redirect hops — each hop revalidated in turn, since `HTTPClient` disables
  Req's automatic redirect following precisely so a public host cannot bounce
  us onto an internal address. Where each hop points is resolved by
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.RedirectLocation`, shared with the other two
  subsystems that follow redirects by hand.
