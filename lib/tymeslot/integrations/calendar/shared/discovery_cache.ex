defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Shared.DiscoveryCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Short-lived cache for CalDAV calendar-discovery results.

  Discovery is a slow remote round-trip (PROPFIND against the provider's CalDAV
  endpoint), so repeated lookups for the same account within the TTL collapse
  onto a single request. Backed by ETS through
  `Tymeslot.Infrastructure.CacheStore`, which also coalesces concurrent misses
  for the same key — a stampede of simultaneous discovery requests (e.g. several
  dashboard tabs) hits the provider once rather than once per caller.

  Keys are built by `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Discovery`: a
  `{provider, "username@host"}` tuple (via
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Shared.DiscoveryService.build_cache_key/2`)
  for not-yet-persisted credentials, or a `{provider, integration_id}` tuple
  for an already-persisted integration. Only successful (`{:ok, calendars}`)
  results are retained; the caller invalidates transient failures so they
  are not served stale.
