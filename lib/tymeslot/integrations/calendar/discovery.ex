defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Discovery do
  @moduledoc """
  The single choke point for calendar discovery: rate-limits and caches a
  discovery request, then dispatches it to the resolved provider module.
  For an already-persisted integration, the provider module is resolved
  exactly once and reused for both the rate-limit/cache wrapper and the
  dispatch itself — no second, independent resolution deeper in the call
  chain.

  Every discovery path — an already-persisted integration's "refresh
  calendar list", raw not-yet-persisted credentials
  (`discover_calendars_for_credentials/5`), and the CalDAV/Radicale
  pre-discovery that resolves what a new integration will sync
  (`maybe_discover_calendars/1`) — funnels through here. CalDAV-family
  providers are metered and cached under the `:discovery`
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.ConnectionProbe` bucket; OAuth providers
  (Google, Outlook) are deliberately not, since their discovery is a single
  call to a fixed vendor endpoint rather than a server-side fetch of a
  user-supplied host — there is no outbound-request amplification to guard
  against, and no shared result worth caching.

  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Shared.DiscoveryService` holds only the
  residue every discovery path shares (cache-key derivation, standardizing
  provider results); it has no provider dispatch and does not meter
  anything itself.

  Discovers calendars for a CalDAV-family provider given raw connection

  This is the metered/cached discovery core, used both by
  `discover_calendars_for_credentials/5` (not-yet-persisted credentials) and
  by `discover_caldav_calendar_paths/1` (the creation-flow's opportunistic
  pre-discovery). `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Connection.validate_connection/2`
  also calls it directly for its CalDAV branch.

  ## Parameters
  - `provider` - The provider type (any atom returned by
    `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.ProviderConfig.caldav_based_providers/0`)
  - `config` - Configuration map with base_url, username, password
  - `opts` - Options:
    - `:force_refresh` - bypass the cache
    - `:actor` - required. Charged only on a real cache miss (i.e. only
      when discovery actually reaches the network), never on a cache hit.

  ## Returns
  - `{:ok, calendars}` - List of discovered calendars
  - `{:error, {category, message}}` - A provider failure, classified from the
    raw error before `message` was localised. Callers that need to act on the
    failure read `category`; `message` is display text only.
  - `{:error, {:rate_limited, message}}` / `{:error, :unattributable}` - the
    rate-limit choke point's own refusals, passed through untouched.
    `:rate_limited` is deliberately distinct from the `:rate_limit` category,
    so the two 2-tuples never blur together.

  Resolves the calendars a CalDAV-family integration is about to be created
  with. Non-CalDAV providers pass through unchanged.

  A caller that already carries a selection (`:calendar_list`, which the
  dashboard form fills from the calendars the user ticked) is left alone.
  Otherwise the server is asked what it has, and every calendar it answers
  with is selected — the connection forms that submit no selection (the
  onboarding wizard) mean "sync this account", not "sync nothing".

  Returns `{:error, %{discovery: message}}` when that leaves nothing to sync.
  A CalDAV sync iterates `calendar_paths` and nothing else, so an integration
  saved with an empty selection is inert: it can never sync, and it has no
  calendar to book into. Refusing here is the last moment the person
  connecting is still present to fix the URL or the credentials, or to create
  a calendar on a server that has none — Tymeslot never issues MKCALENDAR, so
  an account with no collection stays empty until its owner makes one in
  their own client. Every alternative surfaces the same dead end hours later
  and a long way from its cause.

  `calendar_list` and `calendar_paths` are written together, through
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Selection.calendar_list_attrs/1`. Writing
  the paths alone leaves an empty calendar list behind, and the first
  re-discovery then derives an empty selection from that list and wipes the
  paths — the same inert row, reached one step later.
