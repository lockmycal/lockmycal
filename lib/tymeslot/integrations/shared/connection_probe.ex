defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.ConnectionProbe do
  @moduledoc """
  Single choke point for connection-test rate limiting.

  A "connection test" is any provider check that reaches out over the
  network to confirm credentials/reachability. Every caller that needs a
  rate-limited connection test — the dashboard's "Test connection" button,
  integration-creation pre-checks, and calendar discovery (folded in under
  the `:discovery` bucket) — builds a `Request` and calls `probe/1`, rather
  than calling the rate limiter directly. Providers themselves never call
  the rate limiter either: `probe/1` is the only place that does, and the
  `CredoChecks.RateLimiterBoundary` check enforces that mechanically.

  Every OAuth-backed and dev-only provider draws from a real bucket now
  (`:oauth` for OAuth providers, `:unmetered` only for dev-only demo/debug
  providers), so this module is the *only* place an interactive connection
  test can go unmetered — no compensating guard belongs anywhere else, web
  layer included.

  Each provider declares its own bucket via its behaviour's
  `connection_test_bucket/0` callback, rather than this module maintaining a
  table of provider -> bucket mappings: a provider that omits the callback
  fails compilation instead of silently running unmetered. `Request.bucket`
  overrides that lookup for a caller whose metering has nothing to do with
  any one provider's own bucket (calendar discovery draws from `:discovery`
  regardless of which CalDAV-family provider is being discovered against).

  ## Background probing is unmetered by construction

  `Request.scope: :background` (the scheduled health probe) skips metering
  entirely — no actor resolution, no bucket lookup, no rate-limiter call.
  This is a deliberate function-clause dispatch in `probe/1`, not a silent
  default: the scheduler already owns its own cadence (a 30-minute floor
  plus its own exponential backoff on failure), so a token bucket protects
  nothing there and only adds a way for the scheduler's own result to be
  corrupted by an unrelated refusal. `HealthCheck.orchestrate_health_check/2`
  additionally short-circuits on a `{:rate_limited, _}` refusal as
  belt-and-braces, in case a caller ever passes `scope: :background` through
  a path that still resolves a bucket.

  ## Error contract

  A refusal is always tagged, never flattened into free text: `{:error,
  {:rate_limited, message}}` carries the limiter's own user-facing message,
  `{:error, :unattributable}` means the caller could not resolve who to
  charge. Building copy for `:unattributable` is the *caller's* job — this
  module never invents user-facing text, so a caller with no web-facing
  consumer for the distinction is free to flatten it back down for its own
  purposes (see `Calendar.Connection.probe/3`, `Video.Connection.probe/3`).

  Both charge exactly one token, to exactly one actor, before running the
  provider's test — regardless of how many network calls that provider makes
  internally.

  Whatever validation a domain wants runs first and always unmetered, so a
  structurally invalid config never burns rate-limit budget. The two domains
  differ in what that means: Video always has a freshly-built config to
  check, whereas Calendar mostly probes already-persisted integrations,
  which must not be re-validated against current input rules (see
  `Calendar.Connection.test_connection/2`).

  The whole connection-probe algorithm: validate, then (for an `:interactive`
  request) charge one token to `req.actor` in `req.bucket` — or the
  provider's own declared bucket, if `req.bucket` is `nil` — then run.

  A `:background` request skips the charge step entirely: see the moduledoc.

  `req.validate` runs before any token is charged. A caller with nothing to
  validate passes a function returning `:ok` — spelling that out at the call
  site keeps "this path deliberately does not validate" visible in code
  instead of buried in a moduledoc.

  `req.run` performs the actual I/O. It is a closure rather than a
  `{module, config}` pair because callers reach their provider differently:
  Calendar calls the provider module directly, Video routes through
  `ProviderAdapter` so its logging stays uniform, and discovery dispatches
  dynamically across the CalDAV-family provider modules.
