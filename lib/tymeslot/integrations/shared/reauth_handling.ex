defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.ReauthHandling do
  @moduledoc """
  Shared handler for the paths that end in "the user has to reconnect".

  The original caller was the "credentials no longer decrypt" path: when a
  query module returns `{:error, :requires_reencryption, integration}`, callers
  delegate here to log a warning, flag the integration for reauthentication,
  and return a normalised result. Permanent OAuth failures (an expired or
  revoked grant, credentials the provider now rejects) share the same
  side-effects but not the same diagnosis, so the reason is carried explicitly
  as a `t:cause/0`.

  Two distinct return shapes are available depending on context:

  - `flag/2` — returns `:ok | {:error, changeset}`. Suitable for non-Oban
    callers (fetch helpers, token refreshers) that just want the side-effect
    and a simple success/failure signal.

  - Oban workers that need `{:discard, _} | {:error, _}` build that shape
    themselves on top of `flag/2`, typically via the
    `CalendarManagement.handle_reauth_required/2` or
    `Video.handle_reauth_required/2` wrappers.

  Why the integration needs reconnecting.

  * `:credentials_undecryptable` — the stored ciphertext no longer decrypts
    under the current encryption key.
  * `:expired_grant` — the OAuth grant has expired or the user revoked it.
  * `:rejected_credentials` — the provider rejected the credentials for some
    other permanent reason (`invalid_client`, `access_denied`, a bare 401).
  * `:rejected_subscription_url` — a published calendar feed rejected the
    stored subscription link (401/403), which means it was revoked or
    rotated rather than that any credentials expired.

  Which `t:cause/0` a permanent credential failure describes.

  `invalid_grant` and `:token_expired` mean the grant itself is gone: expired,
  or revoked by the user in their provider account. Anything else the provider
  refused counts as rejected credentials. The two get different messages
  because they send the owner to different places.

  A binary reason is matched on whole-word tokens, so the marker has to reach
  this function intact: a caller that replaces the provider's error text with
  its own wording loses the distinction.

  Flags an integration for reauthentication.

  Options (keyword list):

  - `:mark_needs_reauth` — a `(integration, message) -> {:ok, _} | {:error, changeset}`
    function that persists the flag. **Required.**
  - `:cause` — a `t:cause/0` selecting the diagnosis logged and persisted.
    Defaults to `:credentials_undecryptable`.
  - `:provider_label` — a function extracting the provider string from the
    integration, e.g. `& &1.provider`. Defaults to `& &1.provider`.
  - `:log_prefix` — a short label used in log messages, e.g. `"Calendar"` or
    `"Video"`. Defaults to `"Integration"`.

  Logs a warning, calls `mark_needs_reauth`, then:

  - Returns `:ok` on `{:ok, _}`.
  - Logs an error and returns `{:error, changeset}` on `{:error, changeset}`.
