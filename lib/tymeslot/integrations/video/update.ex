defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Update do
  @moduledoc """
  Updates a video integration from its owner's edit.

  An edit arrives from a form whose credential inputs start blank, since a
  stored secret is never sent back to the browser. A blank credential
  therefore means "keep the stored one", and removing credentials has to be
  asked for explicitly. Supplying a credential counts as reconnecting, so it
  also clears `needs_reauth`.

  A Nextcloud Talk edit is proven against the server, as a new integration
  is, but only when its server, login name or app password actually changes.
  Such a proven edit is the reconnect, so it clears `needs_reauth`; an edit
  that is not proven never does. The stored app password is never sent to a
  different server (another scheme, host or port): moving the integration
  there means entering the app password again, so a moved Nextcloud is
  reconnected by entering its new address together with the app password. A
  new subfolder on the same server keeps the stored one.

  MiroTalk, Jitsi and the custom video link are keyed on their address
  (`Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.AccountKey`), so a new address moves the key
  with it and is refused when another of the owner's integrations, active or
  not, already holds it.

  Only a proven edit saves through `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Reconnect`,
  which catches the integration's rooms up on the changes they missed while it
  needed reconnecting. An unproven clear never does.
