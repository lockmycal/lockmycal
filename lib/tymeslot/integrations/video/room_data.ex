  @moduledoc """
  Structured result of a video provider's `create_meeting_room/1` callback.

  Built once by the provider (always atom-keyed, since it only ever lives in
  memory — there is no database column or JSON round-trip anywhere in this
  pipeline) and threaded through join-URL, lifecycle-event, and metadata
  calls via `MeetingContext`.

  # with, so it is kept out of every inspected form: a log line, a crash
  # report or an error tuple that happens to include the struct.

  `adopted` says the provider handed back a room it had already made for this
  booking rather than making one now (Nextcloud Talk does this when an earlier
  attempt's answer never arrived). Such a call proves nothing about what the
  server would do with a new room.
