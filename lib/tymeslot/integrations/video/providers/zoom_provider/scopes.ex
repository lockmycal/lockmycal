defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.ZoomProvider.Scopes do
  @moduledoc """
  Zoom OAuth scope rules for the meeting operations Tymeslot performs.

  Zoom apps come in two flavours. Classic apps hold coarse scopes such as
  `meeting:write`, which covers creating, updating and deleting meetings alike.
  Granular apps hold one scope per action — `meeting:write:meeting` creates,
  `meeting:update:meeting` reschedules, `meeting:delete:meeting` cancels — so
  an app that can create a meeting is not thereby allowed to change or delete
  one.

  That asymmetry is the whole reason this module exists: checking a create
  scope before a reschedule or a cancellation waves through a token Zoom then
  rejects at the API with `code 4711`, turning a permanent authorisation gap
  into a retry loop.

  # The operations Tymeslot always asks Zoom for. `:update` is requested by
  # default but lives behind `:zoom_update_scope_enabled`, because whether it
  # can be obtained is a property of the Marketplace app behind a given
  # deployment, not of this code.
  #
  # Zoom gives no signal when an app lacks a requested scope: the authorize
  # request is not rejected, the scope is silently dropped, the rest is
  # consented to, and the shortfall first surfaces as a 4711 on the API call
  # that needed it. So a deployment whose app is not configured for
  # `meeting:update:meeting` must not request it — not because requesting fails,
  # but because requesting it would make the rest of the system believe the
  # scope is obtainable and start asking users to reconnect to get a scope no
  # reconnect can produce.
  #
  # Disable it (`ZOOM_UPDATE_SCOPE_ENABLED=false`) wherever the Zoom app is not
  # configured for the scope. The authorize request, the pre-flight,
  # and whether users are asked to reconnect all follow from this one setting.
