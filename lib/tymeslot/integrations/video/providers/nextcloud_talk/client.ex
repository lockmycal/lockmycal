defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.NextcloudTalk.Client do
  @moduledoc """
  HTTP client for the Nextcloud Talk conversation API (OCS, API v4).

  Transport only: it builds the request, signs in with the login name and app
  password over HTTP Basic, and classifies the response. What a refusal means
  for a booking or an integration is decided by
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.NextcloudTalkProvider`.

  Every request carries `OCS-APIRequest: true`, without which Nextcloud's CSRF
  check refuses it, and asks for JSON. Every request goes through the SSRF
  guard, which also refuses to follow redirects, so a redirect is reported
  rather than followed.

  Never probe a conversation with GET: Nextcloud counts a GET for an unknown
  token as a brute-force attempt against the calling address, whereas a DELETE
  for one is not. Listing the signed-in user's conversations carries no such
  protection, so a conversation is looked for there instead.

  A conversation token is checked against Talk's own route constraint (4 to 30
  lowercase letters and digits) before any request is built, so a malformed
  token can never reshape the request path.

    * `{:rejected, status, error}`: a 400 or 403 Talk itself answered, with the OCS `error` key when the body has one
