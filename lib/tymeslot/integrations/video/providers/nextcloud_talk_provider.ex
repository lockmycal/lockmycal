defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.NextcloudTalkProvider do
  @moduledoc """
  Nextcloud Talk video conferencing provider.

  Every booking gets its own public Talk conversation on the organiser's
  Nextcloud, created through the conversation API when the booking is
  confirmed. Guests join from its link without an account and type a display
  name. The organiser owns the conversation, so they moderate and skip the
  lobby, but only when signed in to Nextcloud in the browser they join from.
  The lobby lifts itself at the meeting's start, so early guests wait.

  A guest may join the call, speak, share video and their screen and post in
  the chat, but only the organiser opens the call, which
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.NextcloudTalk.BookingConversation`
  describes.

  The conversation token is the room id, which rescheduling and cancelling
  address: a reschedule moves the lobby timer and renames the conversation, a
  cancellation deletes it, and a scheduled clean-up deletes it some days after
  the meeting has ended. A conversation already deleted on the server counts as
  deleted, and so does one its owner marked to be preserved. A refusal that would repeat on every attempt (a 400 or 403, a
  redirect) is reported as a configuration error, which the sync job discards
  rather than retries.

  At creation, a refusal caused by the server's own settings (conversation
  creation limited to some groups, Talk limited to some groups, a password
  enforced on public conversations) carries a code of
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.RoomCreationError`, which records it on the
  integration and tells its owner how to fix it. A connection test someone
  asked for, saving the integration included, refuses such a server up front
  where Talk's capabilities announce the restriction.

  Creation first looks for a conversation an earlier attempt made for the same
  booking, as `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.NextcloudTalk.BookingConversation`
  describes, so a retry never leaves a second one behind.

  The join link is `<server>/index.php/call/<token>`. That form works whether
  or not the server has pretty URLs configured; the shorter `/call/<token>` is
  a 404 on a server without them. The link is the same for every participant
  and never expires, so `time_bound_join_urls?/1` is not implemented.

  ## Credentials and brute-force protection

  The integration holds the server root in `base_url`, the login name in
  `client_id` and an app password in `client_secret`. Nextcloud counts every
  refused login against the calling address, and a throttled address is
  throttled for every Tymeslot user of that Nextcloud. So a 401 is never
  retried: it flags the integration `needs_reauth`, and while that flag is set
  this module refuses to send the stored credentials anywhere, since
  `build_config/3` carries the flag into every config. Saving an edit that
  changes the server, login name or app password clears it, since such an edit
  is proven against the server first; an edit that changes none of them never
  does.

  A 429, which the client reports as `:rate_limited`, is Nextcloud already
  throttling the calling address. It is not the credential's fault, so nothing
  is flagged, but it is not a fault worth retrying at once either: room
  creation passes `:rate_limited` on, which the room job snoozes on a growing
  interval, and a connection test reports it as `{:throttled, message}`, asking
  the user to wait. That tag is its own, not the `{:rate_limited, message}` of
  Tymeslot's own connection-test limiter, which means the test never ran. A
  reschedule or cancellation passes it on as well, and the sync job snoozes it
  the same way.

  The credentials never enter `RoomData.provider_data` or the meeting
  metadata; they travel only in `RoomData.provider_config`, which is never
  persisted, logged or inspected.
