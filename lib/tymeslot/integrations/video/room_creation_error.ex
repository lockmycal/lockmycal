defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.RoomCreationError do
  @moduledoc """
  Why a video provider refuses to create rooms for an integration, and what the
  owner is told about it.

  A provider can accept an integration's credentials and still refuse every
  room, because of a setting on its own server: a Nextcloud that limits who may
  create conversations, or enforces a password on public ones. No retry fixes
  that, so the room job announces the booking without a link and gives up. The
  provider reports such a refusal as `{:configuration_error, code}` with one of
  `codes/0`, and `track/2` keeps it on the integration: its dashboard row
  explains it with `message/1`, and the owner is emailed about each code once.

  The error is recorded with the time it was first seen, and a later refusal
  with the same code keeps that time. It is cleared by the next room the
  integration creates, and by a change to its connection proven against the
  server (see `Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.VideoIntegrationQueries.update_credentials/2`).

  The credentials stay valid, so a refusal never flags the integration for
  reconnection: that flag makes every provider call refuse locally, which would
  also stop reschedules and deletions of rooms that already exist.

  Each code is emailed once, and again only if it comes back after
  `resend_after_days/0` without one. The claim on that email is a single
  conditional update of the integration row, so two room jobs failing at once,
  or a job retried, cannot both claim it; the email job is queued in the same
  transaction, and a claim whose email never goes out is given back
  (`release/2`), so the owner is told once rather than never.
