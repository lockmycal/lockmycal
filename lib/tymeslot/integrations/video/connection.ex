  Runs a connection test against an already-loaded integration struct.

  Resolves the provider module from the single source of truth (`ProviderConfig`),
  builds the provider config via its `build_config/3` callback, and delegates to
  the provider's connection test. This is the one canonical connection-test path:
  the user-facing `test_connection/2` wraps it with loading and telemetry, and the
  background health check (`HealthCheck.Assessor`) calls it directly, so both
  exercise an identical pipeline and stay in lockstep as providers change.

  Also the single choke point for rate limiting: resolving the provider
  module, deciding the bucket it draws from, and (for a metered bucket)
  charging the right actor all happen once, inside `ConnectionProbe.probe/1`.
  `:scope` says which of the two callers is asking. It decides who a metered
  test is charged to, and keeping the two apart is the point: a busy
  instance's scheduled probing must never be able to exhaust the budget a
  real user's "Test connection" button draws from — and `:background` is
  unmetered by construction, per `ConnectionProbe`'s moduledoc.

  @doc """
  Runs the rate-limited connection probe for `provider_atom` against `config`,
  charging an already-resolved `actor` when the provider draws from a
  connection-test bucket (each provider's behaviour declares its own bucket
  via `connection_test_bucket/0`, with no default implementation, so a
  provider can't omit it). `validate_config/1` always runs first — for
  metered providers, before `actor` is charged a token — so a structurally
  invalid config never burns rate-limit budget. Routes the actual test
  through `ProviderAdapter.test_connection/2` so logging stays uniform
  across every caller.

  Unlike `test_integration/2`, there is no persisted integration to resolve
  an actor from here — `Video.do_create_integration/2` (the MiroTalk setup
  pre-check), the only caller, already knows who is submitting the form.

  Returns `ConnectionProbe`'s refusal tagged, never flattened to text —
  building copy for it is the caller's job (see the moduledoc on
  `Tymeslot.Integrations.Shared.ConnectionProbe`); `Video.do_create_integration/2`
  passes it straight up to its own caller.
