defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.HealthCheck do
  @moduledoc """
  Health check system for monitoring integration status and automatically
  handling failures.

  ## Architecture

  This module serves as the orchestrator for the health check system, coordinating
  between specialized domain modules:

  - `Monitor`: Tracks health state over time (persisted to DB) and detects status transitions
  - `Scheduler`: Determines when checks should run (backoff, jitter, circuit breakers)
  - `Assessor`: Executes health checks for different integration types
  - `ErrorAnalysis`: Classifies errors and determines recovery strategies
  - `ResponseHandler`: Takes action on health status changes (user notification after 48h)

  ## Orchestration Value

  This module provides:
  - GenServer lifecycle management for periodic scheduling
  - Public API surface for the health check system
  - Stateless orchestration functions called directly by Oban workers
  - Coordination of the check flow: Schedule → Assess → Analyze → Monitor → Respond

  Health state is persisted to the `integration_health_states` table so it
  survives process restarts.

  ## Required Database Indexes

  For optimal duplicate job detection performance on large installations:

      CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_oban_jobs_args_gin
        ON oban_jobs USING gin (args);

  This GIN index supports JSONB field queries used for duplicate detection.
  Without it, queries may be slow on systems with thousands of pending jobs.

  Performs a single health check for an integration.
  Called directly by Oban workers — does not go through the GenServer,
  so multiple checks can run concurrently without serialising.

  ## Orchestration Flow

  1. Fetch integration from database
  2. Get current health state from Monitor (DB-backed)
  3. Use Assessor to test the integration
  4. Use ErrorAnalysis to classify results
  5. Update health state via Monitor
  6. Detect transitions via Monitor
  7. Persist new state to DB via Monitor
  8. Respond via ResponseHandler: flag a permanent auth failure for
     reconnection, then handle the transition

  claims for a server that refuses most syncs while answering the occasional
  one. Resetting the whole row here would restart the 48-hour notification
  clock on every such success, so the badge would flap and the owner would
  never be told. Declaring the integration healthy again is left to the probe's
  flap-protected recovery path, which is also what clears
  `became_unhealthy_at`; see
  `IntegrationHealthStateQueries.clear_sync_failures/2`.

  Records that one sync cycle for this integration failed.

  A sync failure is the only evidence some outages produce. The scheduled
  probe and a sync do not issue the same request — for CalDAV the probe
  PROPFINDs the calendar collection while sync issues a REPORT against it —
  and a server can answer one while refusing the other. When that happens the
  probe is honestly healthy and the integration silently stops syncing:
  production carried a CalDAV integration that failed 1015 of 1026 sync
  attempts across eleven days with a green badge and no alert the whole time.

  Feeding the failure into the same pipeline the probe uses means a streak of
  them raises the badge, the 48-hour notification and the auto-pause sweep,
  without touching the deliberate decision that a single failed cycle is not
  worth retrying to exhaustion or paging an operator over. The streak is
  cleared by the successful sync that follows, via
  `mark_synced_successfully/2`.

  Safe to call for any failure reason: reasons that already flag the
  integration for reconnection simply reach the badge by two routes.
