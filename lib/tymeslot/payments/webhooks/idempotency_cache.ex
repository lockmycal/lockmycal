defmodule Tymeslot.Payments.Webhooks.IdempotencyCache do
  @moduledoc """
  Two-tier idempotency cache for webhook event deduplication.

  - **Tier 1 (ETS)**: Fast in-memory cache for recent events (24 hours)
  - **Tier 2 (Database)**: Persistent storage for long-term deduplication (90 days)

  `reserve/1` is the production entry point. On an ETS miss (cold cache after
  a restart, or an entry that fell out of the 24h TTL) it falls through to
  the database tier before granting a fresh reservation, so an event already
  recorded in the (up to 90-day) `webhook_events` table is never handed out
  as `:reserved` again.

  Uses the centralized CacheStore infrastructure for ETS tier.

  **Single-node reservation only.** The `:processing` slot `reserve/1` grants
  lives in node-local ETS and is not visible to another node until the
  handler finishes and `mark_processed/3` writes the durable `webhook_events`
  row. Two nodes that both receive the same event while it is still in
  flight on the first will both be granted `{:ok, :reserved}` — the database
  check in `confirm_reservation/1` finds nothing yet, because nothing has
  been persisted. On a single-instance deployment (the only topology this
  codebase currently ships) this window does not exist. Making the
  reservation itself durable (a unique-constrained insert into
  `webhook_events` before dispatch, treating a unique-violation as
  `:already_processed`) would close it for a future multi-node deployment.
