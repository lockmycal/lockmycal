defmodule Tymeslot.Analytics.ReconciliationQueries do
  @moduledoc """
  Instance-wide read queries that cross-check booking analytics against
  bookings, for the reconciliation job.

  Unlike the per-organizer query modules, these aggregate across every
  organizer — the reconciliation job monitors the health of the whole
  installation, not one user's dashboard. The untracked-converting query
  deliberately spans both `analytics_events` and `meetings`: detecting
  bookings whose page-view was never recorded is inherently a cross-table
  question.

  All `Repo.*` calls for reconciliation live here per the
  `CredoChecks.RepoCallBoundary` rule.

  ## Salt-awareness and the untracked ratio

  `Fingerprint` rotates the visitor hash salt every UTC day for visitor
  privacy. This means the same visitor hashes to a different value on
  different UTC days, so a page-view on day N and a booking on day N+1 will
  never share a hash. Comparing them across days would systematically
  over-count "untracked" bookings.

  The untracked-converting query therefore only flags a booking as
  untracked when there is no page-view event whose hash matches **and** whose
  `inserted_at` falls on the **same UTC calendar day** as the booking. Within
  a single UTC day the salt is constant, so the match is reliable.

  Residual limitation: bookings where the visitor genuinely browsed on a prior
  UTC day and booked the next day (or later) cannot be hash-verified given the
  daily salt. Such bookings are excluded from the untracked numerator when no
  other events were recorded on the booking day (the `any_same_day_event`
  guard); on busy days where other events do exist they may still be counted as
  untracked — an acceptable false positive that is documented and bounded. The
  ratio therefore measures **same-day tracking loss** rather than lifetime
  tracking loss.
