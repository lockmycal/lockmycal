defmodule Tymeslot.Analytics.Fingerprint do
  @moduledoc """
  Daily-rotated visitor fingerprint for cookie-less unique-visitor counting.

  The salt rotates every UTC day and never leaves the server. The same
  visitor on different days hashes to a different value, so no persistent
  identifier exists. This is the standard cookie-less approach used by
  Plausible and similar privacy-friendly analytics products.
  """

  alias Tymeslot.Clock

  @doc """
  Computes a daily-rotated visitor hash from the network identity (IP +
  user agent).

  The hash deliberately excludes the meeting type: the same person is one
  visitor regardless of how many of an organizer's meeting types they
  browse, so unique-visitor counts are not inflated per page.

  When both IP and user agent are absent the network identity is unknown,
  so the hash falls back to the LiveView `session_id`. This keeps every
  recorded visit attributable to *some* visitor — a null hash would count
  toward total visits but vanish from `count(DISTINCT)` unique counts,
  making the two metrics inconsistent. Only when there is nothing to hash
  at all (no IP, no user agent, no session) does it return `nil`.

  An unresolved network identity may arrive as the sentinel string
  `"unknown"` (from `ClientIP`) or an empty string rather than `nil`. These
  are normalised to `nil` here so the session fallback engages consistently
  regardless of which form the caller passes — without this, distinct
  visitors with no resolvable IP/UA would all collapse onto a single
  `"unknown|unknown"` hash, and callers that pre-normalise would disagree
  with callers that don't, splitting one visitor's page-view and booking
  across two different join keys.
