## 📦 Releases & Feedback

While we are constantly improving the codebase, this repository is published from LockMyCal's development repository in versioned snapshots.

The most significant way you can contribute to LockMyCal is by providing **feedback**. Real-world usage reports, feature ideas, and constructive criticism are what truly help the project evolve. Even if you don't write a single line of code, sharing your experience is the biggest contribution you can make.

## 🚨 Helping Us Debug Issues

If you self-host LockMyCal, one of the most valuable things you can do is enable **admin alerts** and share the resulting reports with us when something breaks. Admin alerts are off by default — your data stays on your server unless you explicitly opt in.

### How to enable

Set two environment variables on your deployment:

```bash
ADMIN_ALERTS_ENABLED=true
ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL=you@example.com
```

Both must be set. If `ADMIN_ALERT_EMAIL` is missing or invalid, no email is sent even when the flag is on.

When enabled, LockMyCal will email you a structured report whenever an alert is raised — failed webhooks, calendar sync errors, stuck Oban queues, broken integrations, and similar issues. Each report includes the alert category, severity, message, and a context table containing your LockMyCal version, deployment type, hostname, timestamp, and any relevant identifiers.

Identical alerts are deduplicated within a 24-hour window, so a persistent issue produces at most one email per day for the same content — you won't be spammed by a tight error loop.

### Sharing reports with the project

These reports are designed to be copy-paste friendly. If you encounter an issue you'd like us to investigate, open a GitHub issue at <https://github.com/lockmycal/lockmycal/issues> and paste the relevant alert. **Please redact any sensitive values** (user IDs, email addresses, charge IDs, internal hostnames) before sharing publicly — we only need the technical details to reproduce the failure.

If the alert references logs, attach the relevant log lines as well. The more context you include, the faster we can diagnose and fix the issue.

- [Docker OAuth Setup Guide](README-Docker.md#oauth-provider-setup)

## 📏 Code Standards

### Elixir Conventions

- Follow the [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise documentation
- Prefer pattern matching over conditional logic
- Keep functions small and focused

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all code
mix format

# Check formatting
mix format --check-formatted
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run Credo for code analysis
mix credo --strict

# Run Dialyzer for type checking
mix dialyzer
```

### Module Organisation

LockMyCal follows a **domain- and feature-driven module structure**. Modules are grouped by what they do for the business, not by technical role. Each domain owns its own schemas, queries, and logic — colocated under one namespace.

```
lib/tymeslot/
├── auth/                     # Authentication domain
│   ├── auth.ex               # Public context API
│   ├── user_schema.ex        # Ecto schema
│   └── user_queries.ex       # Database queries
├── availability/             # Availability calculation domain
├── bookings/                 # Meeting booking domain
├── integrations/             # External service integrations
├── jobs/                     # Oban job definitions
├── meetings/                 # Meeting management domain
├── notifications/            # Email and notification system
├── security/                 # Security and validation
└── workers/                  # Oban background workers
```

### Key Patterns to Follow

1. **Module Aliases**: Always at the top of files, alphabetically ordered
   ```elixir
   defmodule MyModule do
     alias Tymeslot.Auth
     alias Tymeslot.Profiles
     alias TymeslotWeb.CoreComponents
   end
   ```

2. **LiveView Components**: Single root HTML element
   ```elixir
   def render(assigns) do
     ~H"""
     <div class="my-component">
       <%!-- All content wrapped in single element --%>
     </div>
     """
   end
   ```

3. **Repository Pattern**: Use dedicated query modules, colocated with their domain
   ```elixir
   # Good — query module owns all Repo calls
   Tymeslot.Auth.UserQueries.find_by_email(email)

   # Avoid — bypasses the query module boundary
   Repo.get_by(User, email: email)
   ```

4. **Repo calls belong in query modules**: `Repo.get`, `Repo.insert`, `Repo.update`, `Repo.delete`, `Repo.all`, `Repo.one`, `Repo.exists?`, and similar must live in `*_queries.ex` files. Only `Repo.transaction`, `Repo.rollback`, and `Repo.preload` are permitted in domain context modules.

5. **HEEx comments only**: Use `<%!-- --%>` in `.heex` files and `~H` sigils. Never use HTML comments (`<!-- -->`); they are sent to the browser.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mix test

# Run with coverage
mix test --cover

# Run specific test file
mix test test/tymeslot/auth/auth_test.exs

# Run a single test by line number
mix test test/tymeslot/auth/auth_test.exs:42

# Run Elixir tests only (skip JS)
mix test.elixir
```

### Test Coverage

- **Required**: All new public context functions, LiveView events, Oban workers, and controller actions must include tests.
- **Behaviour over implementation**: Assert on return values, database state, and rendered HTML — not internal function calls or private module details.

### Writing Tests

Every test module must declare at least one `@moduletag` from the approved taxonomy defined in `test/support/tag_taxonomy.ex`.

**Domain tags**: `:auth`, `:availability`, `:bookings`, `:calendar`, `:database`, `:emails`, `:integrations`, `:meetings`, `:meeting_types`, `:notifications`, `:payments`, `:profiles`, `:scheduling`, `:security`, `:themes`, `:workers`, and more.

**Web layer tags**: `:components`, `:controllers`, `:live`, `:plugs`, `:hooks`

**Test type tags**: `:unit`, `:integration`, `:schema`, `:queries`, `:migrations`

Example test structure:
```elixir
defmodule Tymeslot.Auth.AuthenticationTest do
  use Tymeslot.DataCase

  @moduletag :auth
  @moduletag :unit

  alias Tymeslot.Auth.Authentication

  describe "authenticate_user/2" do
    test "returns user for valid credentials" do
      user = Factory.insert(:user)

      assert {:ok, authenticated_user} =
        Authentication.authenticate_user(user.email, "valid_password")
      assert authenticated_user.id == user.id
    end

    test "returns error for invalid credentials" do
      assert {:error, :invalid_credentials} =
        Authentication.authenticate_user("invalid@email.com", "wrong_password")
    end
  end
end
```

### Test Organisation

- `test/tymeslot/` - Unit tests for business logic
- `test/tymeslot_web/` - Tests for web layer (controllers, live views)
- `test/support/` - Test helpers and factories

### Test Philosophy

- **Test behaviour, not implementation.** Assert on outcomes visible to callers.
- **One concept per test.** Each test should have a single, clear reason to fail.
- **No `Process.sleep/1`.** Use `assert_receive`, ExUnit async helpers, or Oban's test mode.
- **Mock at system boundaries only.** Mock external HTTP calls and third-party APIs — not your own modules.

## 📝 Contributor Licensing

LockMyCal is distributed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE), and your contributions are accepted under that same licence. You keep the copyright in your work.

### Signing off your commits

LockMyCal uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin](DCO) (DCO). **Every commit in a contribution must be signed off.** The sign-off is how you certify, on the public record and per commit, that you wrote the code or otherwise have the right to submit it.

Add the sign-off automatically with the `-s` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(auth): add GitHub OAuth integration"
```

This appends a line to your commit message using your configured Git name and email:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name and an email you can be reached at. Pull requests are only merged once **all** their commits are signed off. To add the sign-off to commits you have already made, run `git rebase --signoff <base>` (or `git commit --amend -s` for the most recent commit) and force-push the branch.

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-teams-video-integration`
- `fix/calendar-sync-timezone-bug`
- `docs/improve-oauth-setup-guide`
- `refactor/simplify-availability-calculation`

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
```
feat(auth): add GitHub OAuth integration
fix(calendar): resolve timezone conversion bug
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(bookings): add integration tests for meeting creation
refactor(themes): extract common theme utilities
```

The scope is optional and names the **domain** the change is about, as in the examples above. Leave it off when no single domain fits:

```
feat: add Baikal CalDAV calendar integration
```

Sign off every commit with the `-s` flag (`git commit -s`); see [Signing off your commits](#signing-off-your-commits).

The changelog is auto-generated from `feat` and `fix` commits. To exclude a `feat` or `fix` commit from the changelog (e.g. internal test fixes, Dialyzer suppressions), add a `Changelog: skip` footer:

```
fix(auth): unwrap tuple in OAuth session test

Changelog: skip
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure

This repository contains **Core**: the complete, self-contained scheduling product and the open-source codebase for self-hosters. It owns all domain logic, database schemas, migrations, the HTTP endpoint, and the full web UI, under the `Tymeslot.*` and `TymeslotWeb.*` namespaces (kept from upstream [Tymeslot](https://github.com/tymeslot/tymeslot), which LockMyCal is based on). Issues and pull requests are welcome here; accepted changes are merged into LockMyCal's development repository and published back to this one.

The managed cloud offering ([LockMyCal cloud](https://lockmycal.app)) is built in a separate, private repository as a thin overlay that depends on this one. It adds marketing pages, billing, legal agreements, and subscription management. That split shapes a few rules for code in this repository:

### Core/SaaS Boundary

- **Core never references SaaS.** No imports, calls, or checks for SaaS presence anywhere in this codebase. Core behaves identically whether or not the SaaS overlay is deployed on top of it.
- **Feature flags bridge behavioural differences.** When the managed offering needs Core to behave differently, define a config flag here with a safe default (for example `config :tymeslot, :enforce_legal_agreements, false`); the overlay overrides it in its own config.

### Domain-Driven Design

1. **Bounded Contexts**: Each domain (auth, bookings, etc.) is isolated with a single public context module as its API.
2. **Domain Logic**: Business rules live in domain modules, not controllers or LiveViews.
3. **Repository Pattern**: All database access through dedicated `*_queries.ex` modules.
4. **No queries in `mount/3`**: Defer data loading to `handle_params/3` to avoid double-loading.
5. **The web layer calls contexts only**: Everything under `lib/tymeslot_web/` (LiveViews, LiveComponents, controllers, handler and helper modules, function components, themes) is the presentation layer. It calls context functions, never `*_queries.ex` modules, Oban workers or `Oban.insert`, or runtime adapter modules. `CredoChecks.WebLayerBoundary` enforces this.
6. **Contexts enforce ownership** (convention; reviewed by hand, no check): A context function that acts on a user-owned resource checks ownership itself: it takes the acting user or is scoped by them, and returns `{:error, :not_found}` for an id the user does not own. A check in a LiveView is never the only guard. The scoping belongs in the query, so that an id from another account simply misses; a function that loads by id and only then compares owners has already read someone else's row, and the error tuple it returns afterwards is no proof the rule was kept. This is the rule cross-tenant leaks are made of, so a pull request adding a context function that takes a resource id should say how that resource is scoped to the acting user.
7. **Async work stays in the domain** (convention; reviewed by hand, no check): Write it as a synchronous context function; the LiveView runs it asynchronously with `start_async/3` or a task.
8. **UI pre-validation reuses the domain rule** (convention; reviewed by hand, no check): When the UI validates before submitting, it calls the context's predicate rather than restating the rule.

Two of these rules have a build-failing check behind them: `CredoChecks.RepoCallBoundary` for rule 3 and `CredoChecks.WebLayerBoundary` for rule 5. The rest are caught by review, and rule 6 is the one worth slowing down for, since it is an authorisation rule and nothing will fail the build when it is broken.

### Security First

Always consider security when contributing:

1. **Input Validation**: Use security input processors
2. **Rate Limiting**: Apply appropriate rate limits via `Tymeslot.Security.RateLimiter`
3. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data (API keys, tokens)
4. **Sanitisation**: Sanitise all user inputs
5. **Authorisation**: Verify user permissions

### Performance Considerations

1. **Database Queries**: Use efficient queries and indexes
2. **External APIs**: Implement circuit breakers and timeouts
3. **Caching**: Cache expensive operations appropriately
4. **Background Jobs**: Use Oban for async processing — never raw `spawn/1` or `Task.async/1`

## 🎯 LockMyCal-Specific Guidelines

### Theme Development

When creating new themes:

1. **Theme Structure**: Follow the theme behaviour pattern
2. **Component Isolation**: Themes are self-contained — do not reference `app.css` or Tailwind utilities
3. **Consistent Functionality**: All themes must support the same scheduling features
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure mobile compatibility

Example theme structure:
```
lib/tymeslot_web/themes/
└── my_theme/
    ├── theme.ex                 # Theme behaviour implementation
    ├── scheduling/              # Scheduling flow pages
    │   ├── live.ex
    │   ├── wrapper.ex
    │   └── components/          # Theme-specific components
    └── meeting/                 # Meeting management pages
        ├── cancel.ex
        └── reschedule.ex
```

### Integration Providers

When adding new calendar/video providers:

1. **Provider Pattern**: Implement the provider behaviour
2. **OAuth Flow**: Handle authentication properly
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling
4. **Rate Limiting**: Respect provider rate limits
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers for resilience
6. **HTTP Client**: Use `Req` — never `:httpoison`, `:tesla`, or `:httpc`

### Email Templates

For email template changes:

1. **MJML**: Use MJML for responsive templates
2. **Multi-format**: Support HTML and plain text
3. **Attachments**: Include calendar files (.ics) where appropriate
4. **Testing**: Test across email clients
5. **Localisation**: Consider internationalisation

### Database Migrations

1. **Generate migrations** with `mix ecto.gen.migration <name>` — never create migration files manually.
2. **Backfill before constraining**: When adding constraints to existing tables, handle violating rows in the same migration.
3. **Use `IF NOT EXISTS` / `IF EXISTS`** in repair migrations for idempotency.

### Security Contributions

Security-related contributions should:

1. **Follow Security Policy**: Report vulnerabilities privately first
2. **Input Processors**: Use existing security input processors
3. **Validation**: Add comprehensive validation
4. **Logging**: Add appropriate security logging
5. **Testing**: Include security test cases
