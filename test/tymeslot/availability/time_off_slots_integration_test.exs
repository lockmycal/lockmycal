defmodule Tymeslot.Availability.TimeOffSlotsIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end coverage of time off through the availability engine: what a
  booker is offered on the time picker (`Calculate.available_slots/6`), what
  the calendar grid marks bookable (`Calculate.range_availability/6` and
  `BusinessHours.business_day?/3`), and what the booking gate re-derives when
  a submitted slot arrives (`Calculate.offers_slot/6`).

  The three must agree: a day the grid still offers but the picker refuses is
  the failure this feature would produce most easily, since time off is read
  at a different point in each path.

  Also pins the precedence rule — a profile-wide period outranks a
  per-schedule `available` override — which is the one place time off and the
  existing override system can contradict each other.
