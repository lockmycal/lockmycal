  @moduledoc """
  The booking page's own answer, for an owner and a booker on different clocks.

  `TimeSlotsBreakTimezoneTest` pins the slot grid in isolation; this pins the
  composition that actually reaches a visitor, where the owner's breaks are
  read for one date and the window they filter has been shifted into the
  booker's zone. Both halves are needed: the grid can be right about the frame
  it is handed and still be handed the wrong one.
