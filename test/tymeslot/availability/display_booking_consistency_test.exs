defmodule Tymeslot.Availability.DisplayBookingConsistencyTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Invariant tests asserting that the availability-display path and the
  booking-validation path agree.

  The display side is `Offer.slots_for_date/3`, the booking page's own
  pipeline: it reads the host's calendar, resolves the schedule and builds the
  booking-limit check exactly as the page does. A config assembled by hand
  here would test a copy of that pipeline, and a rule the copy carries but the
  page does not is precisely the disagreement these tests exist to catch. The
  booking side is `Create.execute/2`. Nothing in the type system keeps the two
  in sync, so these tests pin the end-to-end invariant: if the display shows a
  slot, the booking API must accept it; if the display hides a slot, the
  booking API must reject attempts to book that time.

  These are the fixed-scenario anchors; `DisplayBookingConsistencyPropertyTest`
  fuzzes the same invariant across timezones, durations and event layouts.
