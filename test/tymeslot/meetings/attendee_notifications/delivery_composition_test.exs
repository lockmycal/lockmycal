defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.AttendeeNotifications.DeliveryCompositionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end composition coverage for the attendee-notification pipeline:

      event trigger → recipient resolution → template rendering → email delivery

  Two hot paths are pinned here:

    * the **end-to-end chain**: `Tymeslot.Meetings.AttendeeNotifications.Worker`
      diffs a calendar event against its `last_notified_state`, bumps
      `ical_sequence`, and enqueues an `EmailWorker` job — the test then feeds
      that job's own args into `perform_job(EmailWorker, …)`, so a rename or
      reshape between producer (`CalendarScheduler.schedule_event_update_notification/1`)
      and consumer (`EmailWorkerHandlers.IntegrationEmails.handle_event_update_notification/2`)
      surfaces here.
    * the **inner** handler's partial-delivery branch, which returns
      `{:discard, "Partial delivery failure: N of M failed"}` when any
      recipient's send fails — a shape nothing else in the suite locks in.
