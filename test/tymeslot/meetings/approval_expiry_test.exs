defmodule Tymeslot.Meetings.ApprovalExpiryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The clock behind the approval gate: the scheduled expiry, the cron sweep,
  and the job cancellation that stops both once a host has answered.

  The user-visible failure these guard against is a request that resolves to
  nothing. An invitee told their time is held until Thursday and then never
  told anything again is worse than a decline, and it is exactly what a lost
  expiry job produces. Hence two independent paths to the same release, and
  tests that each one works when the other does not.
