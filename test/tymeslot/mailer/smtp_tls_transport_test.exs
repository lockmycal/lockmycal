  # Generous on purpose. A tight budget here does not test anything: the
  # relay is an ordinary Erlang process, and if the suite is busy enough that
  # it is not scheduled into `:ssl.transport_accept/2` before the client gives
  # up, the client fails with `{:network_failure, _host, {:error, :timeout}}` —
  # indistinguishable from the relay refusing the certificate, and green or red
  # depending on machine load. Every outcome under test (a completed handshake,
  # a TLS alert) is reached in milliseconds once both sides are running, so
  # nothing waits for this bound except a genuine stall.
