  What survives an edit of an event Tymeslot did not write.

  `build_simple_event/3` serialises Tymeslot's payload and nothing else, so
  applying it to a synced event replaces its `ATTENDEE` block with Tymeslot's
  own and drops everything the cache does not model. The patcher exists so the
  stored document goes back to the server with only the edited properties
  rewritten; these tests pin what it may touch and, more importantly, what it
  may not.
