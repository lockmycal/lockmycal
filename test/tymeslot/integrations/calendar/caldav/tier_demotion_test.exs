defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.TierDemotionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The sync tier is chosen from what a server advertises in its property list.
  Some servers advertise `sync-collection` and then refuse every REPORT that
  uses it: Infomaniak answers 500, and because the stored tier was never
  revisited, one production calendar retried that same refused request every
  fifteen minutes for twelve days and synced only on its daily forced full
  fetch.

  A refusal must therefore demote the integration to the tier that needs no
  extension, and the same cycle must still fetch the events. A server that
  simply failed to answer must not, or a blip of packet loss costs a working
  delta sync.
