defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.HttpSsrfTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Verifies that every call site in `CalDAV.Http` passes `ssrf_protect: true`
  to the HTTP client.

  Each test pins the environment to `:prod` (the condition under which the SSRF
  guard is active) and injects a DNS resolver that always returns a private
  address.  Removing `ssrf_protect: true` from any call site would allow the
  request to reach the Req.Test stub, which calls `flunk/1` — making that test
  fail.

  Tests cover: propfind, report (read path) and put_event, delete_event,
  head_event (write/HEAD path).
