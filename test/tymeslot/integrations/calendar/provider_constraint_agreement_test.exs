defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.ProviderConstraintAgreementTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Pins the two halves of the provider whitelist to each other.

  `ProviderConfig.provider_constraint_list/0` feeds `validate_inclusion` on
  `CalendarIntegrationSchema` and `ProviderCalendarEventSchema`; the database's
  `calendar_integrations_provider_check` is installed by a migration that
  derives from nothing. Only a comment has ever asked the two to agree, so
  every drift between them has been silent, and both directions of drift are
  real bugs: a provider the changeset accepts and Postgres refuses fails at
  insert time with a constraint error no user can act on, and a provider
  Postgres accepts while the changeset refuses is a registration that looks
  complete and is not.

  This file reads the constraint that is actually installed rather than a
  copy of the migration's SQL, so it stays honest as providers are added.
