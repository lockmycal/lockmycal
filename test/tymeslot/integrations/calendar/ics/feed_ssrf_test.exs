  Covers the SSRF-blocked and transport-failure branches of
  `Feed.fetch_events/2`'s `fetch_body/3`, which `FeedTest` deliberately
  leaves to this module.

  Mirrors `Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.CalDAV.HttpSsrfTest`: the blocking
  tests pin the environment to `:prod` (the condition under which
  `SsrfGuard` is active) and inject a DNS resolver so both a literal
  private/link-local target and a public-looking host that resolves to one
  are exercised without any disallowed network access.
