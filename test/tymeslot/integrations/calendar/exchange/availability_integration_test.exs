defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Calendar.Exchange.AvailabilityIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Exercises the whole path an Exchange mailbox's busy time travels to reach a
  booking page: `ClientManager.clients/1` resolving the integration to the
  whole-mailbox client `build_client_configs/1` produces,
  `Exchange.Provider.list_events/2` answering it from the local event cache,
  and the slot engine dropping the slots that interval covers.

  The HTTP client is stubbed to `flunk/1` for the whole module, so the two
  halves of the design are pinned by the same tests: the cache is read, and
  the network is not. A regression that puts the live `FindItem`/`GetItem`
  read back behind the callback fails here on the flunk rather than on a
  subtle difference in the events returned.
