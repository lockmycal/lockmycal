defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.HealthCheck.MonitorConcurrentTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the health-check lifecycle under concurrent
  or sustained failure scenarios that no single unit test pins down.

  Two invariants are covered:

    * **Uniqueness-configuration pin.** Two sequential callers inside
      the shared Ecto sandbox running the full health-check lifecycle
      (get_state → update_health → put_state → detect_transition →
      handle_transition) on an integration that has already been
      unhealthy for >48h must enqueue exactly one user notification
      email — not zero (both suppressed), not two (silent duplicate).
      The guarantee rests on Oban's `unique:` job constraint. Note:
      the Ecto sandbox serialises Task DB access, so this test pins
      the uniqueness *configuration* under the same execution order,
      not true DB-level concurrency. A future change to the constraint
      or the lifecycle would still surface here.

    * **Transient-failure grace period.** A healthy integration that
      sees a burst of transient errors during (for example) a deploy
      rollout must not flip to `:unhealthy`. `update_health/2`'s
      backoff ramp (5 → 10 → 20 → 40 → 60min) only starts incrementing
      `failures` once the backoff has reached the max. A walk through
      the ramp confirms no `:became_unhealthy` transition fires during
      the grace period.
