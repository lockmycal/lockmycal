defmodule Tymeslot.Integrations.Video.Providers.CustomProviderSsrfTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers the request-time half of the video private-IP opt-out: the reachability
  probe behind the custom provider's "test" button.

  That probe used to run its own hand-rolled `:inet.getaddr/2` check, which no
  config key could switch off and which fired in every environment. Reaching an
  internal meeting server was therefore impossible however the operator
  configured the deployment. These tests pin the replacement: the probe goes
  through `SsrfGuard` with the video-scoped allowance, so it is blocked by
  default and permitted once the operator opts in.

  The blocked cases stub `Req.Test` with `flunk/1`: if `ssrf_protect: true` ever
  goes missing from the call site, the request reaches the stub and the test
  fails rather than quietly passing.
