defmodule Tymeslot.Webhooks.HttpDeliveryPinningTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A webhook's SSRF verdict is made about a hostname. Unless the delivery then
  connects to the address that verdict approved, the HTTP client resolves the
  same name again at connect time and a short-TTL record can answer public to
  the check and loopback to the socket — DNS rebinding, which needs no redirect.

  These tests assert the delivery hands the approved address to the HTTP client
  as the connect target, and the original hostname alongside it so TLS and
  virtual-host routing still work. Every hop is checked separately, because
  each hop resolves separately.

  `:req_test_plug` is cleared here: the suite normally routes Req through a
  test plug, which opens no socket and is therefore deliberately never pinned.
