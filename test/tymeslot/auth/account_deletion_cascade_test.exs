defmodule Tymeslot.Auth.AccountDeletionCascadeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Enumerates every database-level association that a user owns and pins
  the intended outcome of `Auth.delete_account/1` for each. The
  cascades are set in migrations (`on_delete: :delete_all` or
  `:nilify_all`), so any reversal — an accidental `:restrict`, a new
  table wired in without an FK cascade, a `nilify_all` silently
  reverting to app-level control — would leave orphan rows or PII
  after a user exercises their GDPR right-to-delete. This test makes
  that invariant explicit across the full association graph.

  Each assertion carries the intended outcome inline: either
  **deleted** (row removed) or **anonymised** (row remains but no
  longer references the deleted user). Adding a new user-keyed table
  should add a new row here.

  Oban jobs are not a foreign-key cascade: the user's pending jobs are
  deleted by the deletion transaction itself
  (`ObanJobQueries.delete_pending_jobs_for_user/2`), pinned in
  `Tymeslot.Workers.AccountDeletionWorkerTest`.
