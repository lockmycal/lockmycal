defmodule Tymeslot.Auth.RegistrationVerificationRateLimitTest do
  @moduledoc """
  `Verification.send_verification_email/2` may refuse to send, returning the
  three-element `{:error, :rate_limited, message}` alongside the two-element
  form. `Registration` used to `case` over only the two-element
  one, so a refusal raised `CaseClauseError` from inside the LiveView.

  The crash was the visible half. The damage was that it struck after the user
  row was committed but before the profile and the registration broadcast, so
  the address was rejected as a duplicate on retry and the account could never
  be reached. These tests hold both halves: the refusal is returned rather than
  raised, and whatever the outcome the account is left whole.

  A refusal also no longer changes the reply at all: a taken address never
  sends a verification email, so a distinct "could not be sent" answer would
  tell a visitor the address was free. The account waits for a resend.

  The verification module is resolved at runtime via `Application.get_env/3`,
  which is why Dialyzer could not see the missing clause; the limit is
  therefore exhausted for real here rather than mocked.
