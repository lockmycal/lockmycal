  The two emails a held booking produces.

  Rendering is itself the load-bearing assertion: `MjmlEmail.compile_mjml/1`
  raises on malformed markup, so a template that builds at all has produced
  valid MJML. The rest pins the wording that has to be right — that the
  invitee is not told the meeting is confirmed, and that no calendar file
  goes out promising a time nobody has agreed to.
