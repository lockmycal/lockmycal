defmodule Tymeslot.Migrations.CreateVenuesTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Value-correctness regression for the `create_venues` migration, which
  moves the free-text address of every in-person location into a saved
  venue the location then lists.

  The rows are put into the old shape with raw SQL, because the schema can
  no longer write it, and the migration that ships is then run over them.

  The decisive property is that **no address is lost and none is shared
  across owners**: a booker keeps seeing exactly the address the organiser
  typed, and never another account's.
