defmodule Tymeslot.Migrations.DirtySeedMigrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Runs every migration written since the seed's pinned schema version against a
  database pre-seeded with adversarial data. Catches constraint violations,
  failed backfills, and data assumptions that don't hold for real-world
  installations.

  ## Why a pinned version rather than "the last N migrations"

  The failure this test exists to catch is a migration that succeeds on an empty
  database and fails on a populated one: a NOT NULL column added without a
  backfill, a unique index built over duplicate rows, a check constraint older
  rows violate, an `UPDATE ... FROM` that trips over an orphan. Everything else
  in the gate runs migrations against an empty database, so this is the only
  place that failure shows up.

  Seeding that data requires the seed's `INSERT`s to match the schema they are
  loaded against. Pinning the split point to a fixed version is what makes that
  possible: `migration_dirty_seed.sql` is written once against the schema as of
  `@seed_schema_version` and never has to be rewritten again, because the
  schema it is loaded against never moves. A "last N migrations" window instead
  slides the load point forward with every migration added, so each new
  constraint or table rename eventually invalidates rows that were valid when
  they were written — a red build about the seed file, not about the migration
  under test.

  Pinning also widens the range: a migration stays covered until the pin is
  deliberately moved past it, instead of ageing out after N more land. It costs
  nothing extra to run, because either way the run applies every migration.

  The residual gap is that the seed cannot populate a table or column created
  after the pin, so a migration constraining a table younger than the pin still
  meets it empty. That is the trigger for moving the pin forward: add the rows
  you need, move the pin to cover them, and repair whatever the newer schema
  rejects. `CredoChecks.MigrationConstraintSafety` is the static backstop that
  covers the gap in the meantime.

  This test is intentionally slow and non-async — it manipulates the real
  database schema outside the sandbox.
