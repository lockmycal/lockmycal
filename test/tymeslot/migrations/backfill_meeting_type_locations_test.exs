defmodule Tymeslot.Migrations.BackfillMeetingTypeLocationsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Value-correctness regression for
  `20260903113518_add_locations_to_meeting_types`, which gives every existing
  meeting type the single-entry location list that means exactly what its
  `allow_video` / `video_integration_id` pair already meant.

  The migration is driven directly rather than reimplemented: `down` drops
  the column, putting the rows back in the pre-migration shape, and `up`
  re-adds and backfills it, so the assertions are about the SQL that ships.

  The decisive property is that **no row is left without a location**. Every
  reader of the list treats an empty one as "fall back to the old fields",
  which works but leaves the host's editor showing a location they never
  authored, so the backfill is what makes the list the honest source of truth.

  Runs non-async because it drops and re-adds a live column for the duration
  of the test; the sandbox rolls the DDL back with everything else.
