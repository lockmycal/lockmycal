defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEditProviderSplitExceptionsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  An organiser edits one occurrence of a Google or Outlook recurring event
  and every following one, in a series where later occurrences were edited
  or cancelled on their own. Those occurrences are separate from the
  series' rule on both providers, and the provider drops them once the
  original series is ended before them, so they are read before the split
  and written again to the new series: an edited one keeps its own changes,
  and a cancelled one stays cancelled.

  As in `Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEditProviderSplitTest`, only the HTTP
  client is mocked, and every request is recorded in the order it was made.
