defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventCreationAvailabilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Pins what drawing an event on the calendar grid does to the organiser's
  cached availability.

  Blocking an hour on the grid is the ordinary way a host makes themselves
  unavailable, so the booking page must stop offering that time straight
  away. Availability is memoised per user for the cache's TTL, and the events
  behind it are fetched live from the providers, so the create has to drop the
  organiser's entries or the page keeps offering the slot until they expire.

  A create the provider refused and the offline queue swallowed is the other
  half of the contract: that event exists on no server yet, the slot really is
  still free, and dropping the cache would buy nothing but a slower next page
  load. These tests assert both directions.
