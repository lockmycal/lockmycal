defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.TeamsSeparateEventCleanupTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The separate Outlook event a Teams meeting gets when it cannot be attached
  to the grid event itself: the Teams integration is on another Microsoft
  account than the Outlook calendar, or the calendar is not Outlook at all.

  That event is the Teams room. Once the grid event no longer uses it
  (deleted, switched to another provider or to none, or given a fresh Teams
  room) it should be deleted, and when the grid event moves in time it should
  move too, as a booking's own Teams event does. The meeting attached to the
  grid event itself must never be deleted as a room, since its id is the grid
  event's own.

  Every scenario is set up through `CalendarGrid.change_event_video/3`, so
  whatever that path records about the room is what the later action sees.
  The calendar is stubbed at `Tymeslot.CalendarMock`; the Teams provider runs
  for real against Microsoft Graph stubbed at `Tymeslot.HTTPClientMock`. Room
  work queued on `Tymeslot.Workers.VideoSyncWorker` is drained before the
  Graph requests are read, so the assertions hold whether the clean-up runs
  inline or queued. The stubbed join links are opaque, as Teams' own are:
  nothing in them names the event they live on.
