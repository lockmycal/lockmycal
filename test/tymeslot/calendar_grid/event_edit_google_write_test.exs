defmodule Tymeslot.CalendarGrid.EventEditGoogleWriteTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What a grid edit of a synced Google event actually puts on the wire.

  `EventEditTest` stops at the `:calendar_module` seam and pins the payload;
  this module points that seam back at the runtime module so the edit travels
  the whole way down (grid domain, provider adapter, Google API client) and
  the JSON body Google receives can be read.

  `events.update` is a `PUT`, so the attendee array in the body becomes the
  attendee array on the event. An attendee sent without a `responseStatus`
  therefore comes back as `needsAction`, and because the write suppresses
  Google's own notifications nobody is told their reply was discarded. That
  loss is invisible from either end: the payload is complete, the write
  succeeds and the organiser's rename lands.
