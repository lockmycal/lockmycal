  `CalendarGrid.move_event/3` creates the whole event on the destination
  before deleting the original, so no failure along the way can lose it.

  Both provider writes are stubbed at the suite-wide `:calendar_module` seam
  (`Tymeslot.CalendarMock`), which is where `Calendar.Events.create_event/2`
  and `delete_event/3` dispatch. Each stub reports its call to the test
  process, so the order of the two writes is observable.
