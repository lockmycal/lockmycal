defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.ExchangeIncrementalSyncTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers the incremental half of the Exchange item read: the `SyncFolderItems`
  change feed, the per-folder tokens it is driven by, and the daily full re-read
  that backstops it.

  Split from `SyncExchangeCalendarWorkerTest`, which is about keeping the two
  halves of the cache apart. This one is about a different risk. The full read
  is self-healing — it replaces a role's rows wholesale, so a missed change
  costs one cycle — and the incremental read is not: a deletion the feed fails
  to state is a row that stays on the grid, and a token stored after a failed
  run acknowledges changes nobody applied. Every test here is one of those
  ways for the cache and the mailbox to drift apart in silence.
