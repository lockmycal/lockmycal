defmodule Tymeslot.Workers.SyncExchangeCalendarWorkerTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers the worker that refreshes an Exchange mailbox into the local event
  cache.

  Exchange is the only provider whose sync writes two populations of rows from
  two different EWS operations, so most of what is asserted here is about
  keeping them apart: that availability is served from `GetUserAvailability`
  and never from the items, that neither half's refresh deletes the other's
  rows, that a busy interval actually removes a bookable slot, and that a
  synthesised uid can never reach the cancellation path a real provider event
  id would.
