defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.LocationChoiceIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end coverage of the booker choosing where a meeting is held.

  The booker submits an option id and nothing else. Everything that follows
  from it — the location string the calendar event and confirmation emails
  show, the recorded kind, and whether a video room is created and on which
  integration — is derived server-side from the host's own meeting type, so
  these tests drive the real booking path rather than `LocationSelection` in
  isolation.
