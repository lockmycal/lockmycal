defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.BookingZoomIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end integration test for the public booking → Zoom meeting journey.

  Covers the full chain a Zoom App Marketplace reviewer exercises:

  1. A booking is submitted through `Orchestrator.submit_booking/2` against a
     meeting type whose video provider is Zoom (the integration is resolved
     from the meeting type, not passed in the form params).
  2. The booking enqueues `VideoRoomWorker`.
  3. The worker creates the Zoom meeting, firing both Zoom API calls the app's
     scopes are granted for: `POST /users/me/meetings` (meeting:write:meeting)
     and the read-back `GET /meetings/{id}` (meeting:read:meeting).
  4. The Zoom join link is attached to the meeting.

  The provider/worker layers are unit-tested separately; this test guards the
  seam between them so a booking can never silently skip the Zoom API calls.
