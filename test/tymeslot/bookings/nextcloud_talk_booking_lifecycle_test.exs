defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.NextcloudTalkBookingLifecycleTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A booking on a Nextcloud Talk integration from end to end.

  A Talk conversation is an object on the organiser's server with a lifecycle
  of its own, so every step here runs through the entry point that drives it in
  production: the booking submission and the room job it queues, a reschedule,
  a cancellation and the daily clean-up. The jobs they queue are drained from
  the queue, not built by hand. Only the HTTP client is stubbed: it plays the
  Nextcloud server and records every request it receives, so each step asserts
  exactly what Nextcloud was sent, and then what the booking holds.
  """

  # Not async: the room job calls the provider from a supervised task, which
  # needs the global Mox mode, and the Talk circuit breakers are VM-wide.
