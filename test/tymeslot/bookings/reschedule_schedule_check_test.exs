defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.RescheduleScheduleCheckTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression coverage for the reschedule path enforcing the organiser's
  weekly availability and never taking the meeting's duration from the
  request.

  Before this, `Reschedule.execute/4` ran no schedule check at all: an
  attendee holding a legitimate reschedule link could move a meeting to a
  time the organiser's schedule never offered (outside business hours, on a
  day off, inside a break, or onto an "unavailable" override), and the new
  duration was taken from the attendee-supplied URL slug rather than the
  meeting's own persisted duration.
