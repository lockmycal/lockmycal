defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.RescheduleNotificationsIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  End-to-end coverage of the notification half of `Reschedule.execute/4`, run
  against the **real** email service rather than the Mox double.

  Issue #76: the reschedule payload was built by a different builder than the
  one every email template is written against, so rendering the attendee email
  raised a `KeyError` on a key the payload never carried. The raise escaped
  `Notifications.Events.meeting_rescheduled/2` before it reached the webhook,
  Telegram and Slack dispatches, so an attendee rescheduling through their own
  link silently lost every downstream channel — and the booking LiveView died
  on the error instead of rendering the confirmation.

  Mocking the email service is exactly what hid it: the templates never ran.
  These tests render for real, and pin the containment that keeps one failed
  channel from silencing the rest.
