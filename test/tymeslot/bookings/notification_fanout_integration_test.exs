defmodule Tymeslot.Bookings.NotificationFanoutIntegrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Integration coverage for the seam between the booking domain and the
  outbound notification fan-out.

  `Tymeslot.Notifications.Events` is exercised directly elsewhere
  (`Tymeslot.Notifications.EventsTest`) with a factory meeting, and each
  dispatcher is unit-tested in isolation. Neither proves the seam: that a
  *real* booking action reaches `Events` at all. Nothing failed when the
  `Events.meeting_created/1` call was the thing that broke, because every
  test either called `Events` itself or stopped at the dispatcher.

  The three call sites that matter each own a lifecycle transition:

    * `Bookings.Create.execute/2`      → `Events.meeting_created/1`
    * `Bookings.Reschedule.execute/4`  → `Events.meeting_rescheduled/2`
    * `Bookings.Cancel`                → `Events.meeting_cancelled/1`
    * `Meetings.Approval.approve/1`    → `Events.meeting_created/1`, which
      announces a booking a reschedule sent back for approval as
      `meeting.rescheduled` instead

  Each test drives the real domain function and asserts the Slack, Telegram
  and webhook delivery jobs land with the event type that transition
  promises. A regression here is silent in production: the booking still
  succeeds, the organiser simply never hears about it.

  A booking whose meeting type creates a video room does not reach `Events` on
  the booking path at all: it defers the whole event to `VideoRoomWorker` so
  that every notification carries the join link. That branch is covered here
  too, driving the job as well as the booking, because a fixture without a
  video integration exercises only the other half of the `if` and is how this
  module missed the event being dropped for every video booking.
