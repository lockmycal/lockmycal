defmodule Tymeslot.Test.TagTaxonomy do
  @moduledoc """
  Canonical taxonomy of allowed `@moduletag` values for test modules.

  This is the **single source of truth** for test tags across the entire project.
  `CredoChecks.TestModuleTagRequired` fetches the allowed list from here at runtime,
  so adding or renaming a tag only requires a change in this file.

  ## Tag Categories

  | Category          | Purpose                                                        |
  |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Domain / area     | Which business domain or feature the tests cover               |
  | Web layer         | Which web-layer concern the tests exercise                     |
  | Test type / layer | What kind of tests these are (unit, integration, schema, etc.) |
  | Special / env     | Tags used for selective exclusion or CI environment control    |

  One tag in the last category runs the other way round: `:cross_tenant` is never
  excluded, and exists so the authorization tests scattered across several
  feature areas can be run as one slice.

  ## Every Test Module Needs a Domain Tag

  `CredoChecks.TestModuleTagRequired` requires at least one tag from the
  **domain** category, not merely one from the taxonomy. The other categories
  are orthogonal to subject matter: `:unit`, `:live` and `:components` say how a
  test is written or which layer it exercises, and they are spread across every
  feature, so they cannot answer "which tests cover payments?". Targeted runs
  (`mix test --only payments`, `mix test.affected`) select on the domain
  category alone, so a module with no domain tag is unreachable by any of them.

  ## Adding a New Tag

  1. Append the atom to the relevant section in `@taxonomy` below.
  2. Add a brief description in the table above.
  3. Commit the change — the Credo check will accept it automatically on the next run.

  ## Keeping in Sync with `test_helper.exs`

  Tags listed under `:special` that are excluded by default in `ExUnit.configure`
  (e.g. `:oauth_integration`, `:calendar_integration`, `:backup_tests`) must remain
  present here so they are still validated by the Credo check.
