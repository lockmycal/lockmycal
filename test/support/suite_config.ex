  Default `:exclude` tags every suite skips unless explicitly included.

  `:catalogue_freshness` differs from its neighbours: it needs no external
  service, only a great deal of time. Those tests run gettext extraction in a
  subprocess to compare .pot catalogues against source, which force-recompiles
  the app being extracted from, and at ~100s they were the single largest cost
  in the suite that owns them. Excluding them keeps the guarantee on a schedule
  rather than on every local run.

  `:tld_freshness` needs outbound network access to IANA, which a local run
  cannot be assumed to have and which would make the suite fail offline for a
  reason that has nothing to do with the change under test.

  `:git_cliff` is excluded only where the binary is missing, so the changelog
  config tests run by default for anyone able to cut a release (and in the
  release workflow, which installs git-cliff) and are skipped elsewhere rather
  than failing. ExUnit prints the exclusion at the top of the run, so the skip
  is visible rather than silent.
