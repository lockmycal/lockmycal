  Accessibility contract for the shared timezone dropdown used by onboarding
  and profile settings.

  The booking page carried the same defects in its own copies of this control,
  and they are pinned there by
  `TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.BookingAccessibilityTest`. This module covers the
  dashboard-side component, which is a separate implementation and can regress
  independently; the assertions themselves are shared between the two, in
  `TymeslotWeb.AccessibilityAssertions`.
