defmodule TymeslotWeb.Hooks.EmbedAuthCompositionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for `EmbedAuthHook` exercised via the full HTTP →
  LiveView WebSocket mount.

  The existing `embed_auth_hook_test.exs` unit-tests the hook against
  a hand-built socket for each failure mode (tampered token, expired
  token, missing parent_origin, empty/nil/`["none"]` domain list,
  profile not found, wildcard/www matching). The existing
  `embed_pipeline_test.exs` covers the disconnected (static) half of
  the embed request — CSP headers, token generation, token → session
  flow, and successful static render.

  What neither file covers is the static → connected re-validation
  seam: the hook deliberately defers origin verification on the
  disconnected render (so a signed token with any origin can render
  the page statically) and enforces it only on the WebSocket connect.
  A regression that accidentally checked the origin on the static
  render would still pass every existing assertion — the gap is the
  user journey where an attacker frames the page with an unauthorised
  Referer and the connected mount must catch them.

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * `malformed embed token (corrupted Base64 signature) → halt, no
      exception` — covered at
      `embed_auth_hook_test.exs:112` ("halts with redirect for
      tampered token") and `:121` (same, on disconnected render).
      Both feed the literal string `"tampered"` — a corrupted signature
      and a truncated Base64 reach the same `Token.verify/1` error arm,
      so the existing assertions already pin this behaviour.
