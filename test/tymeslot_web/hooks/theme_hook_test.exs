defmodule TymeslotWeb.Hooks.ThemeHookTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Unit tests for `ThemeHook.on_mount/4` focused on the graceful-default
  paths that the hook must satisfy when profile lookups fail.

  The existing `live/themes/theme_hook_test.exs` covers the positive
  end-to-end wiring (Quill and Rhythm video hooks render when the
  profile has matching `booking_theme` + a matching
  `theme_customization`). It does not cover the failure modes the
  hook silently swallows — notably the race where
  `Profiles.get_profile_by_username/1` returns `nil` because the user
  was deleted between route resolution (username extracted by the
  router) and LiveView mount. A regression that made that path raise
  would surface as a crashed scheduling page for any stale link.

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * `feature_assigns_hook when feature checker module is absent /
      raises → safe defaults applied, no crash` — the premise is
      contradicted by production code.
      `TymeslotWeb.Hooks.FeatureAssignsHook` does not invoke a feature
      checker; it only reads
      `Application.get_env(:tymeslot, :feature_assigns, [])` — a list
      of `{key, default_value}` tuples — and assigns them. There is no
      module call to absent-or-raise. The actual checker,
      `Tymeslot.Features.check_access/2`, already has an explicit
      `try/rescue` (`features.ex:48–59`) and is wired into worker and
      context modules, not this hook. A downstream overlay's
      subscription hook that *does* override feature assigns is already
      covered by that overlay's own tests.

    * `nil booking_theme → default theme "1"` — the premise is
      contradicted by production code. `ProfileSchema.booking_theme`
      is defined with `default: Registry.default_theme_id()`
      (`profile_schema.ex:50`), so a profile row without a theme is
      impossible via Ecto. The `%{booking_theme: theme} when
      is_binary(theme)` guard in the hook is a defensive belt-and-
      braces against a state Ecto cannot emit.

    * `socket.private[:theme_id] branch` — no production caller writes
      `theme_id` into `socket.private`. The branch in `extract_theme_id/2`
      (`theme_hook.ex:36–37`) reads `socket.private[:theme_id]` but
      no plug, router, or hook in Core or SaaS ever sets it. The path
      is unreachable and therefore has no test.
