defmodule TymeslotWeb.WebhookCompositionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the Microsoft Graph Outlook Calendar webhook,
  focused on input-shape and rate-limit gaps the existing
  `outlook_calendar_webhook_controller_test.exs` does not pin.

  The existing file covers the happy path, batch handling, clientState
  verification, unknown subscriptions, and the plain-text validation
  challenge. It does not cover the edge paths that would surface
  as incidents on the user:

    * a non-printable validation token — an attacker probing the
      endpoint with binary noise would otherwise receive a 200 with
      the raw token echoed back, which could be framed into a
      content-type-confusion issue;
    * a notification whose shape parses but is missing the nested
      `resourceData.id` — left unpinned, a regression that touched
      `last_outlook_notification_at` here would make the "last
      received" timestamp meaningless (it would advance on every
      malformed Graph burst, masking real silence);
    * a valid notification arriving after the per-integration Hammer
      bucket is exhausted — the controller must still return 202 (Graph
      expects it) but must NOT enqueue `SyncOutlookCalendarWorker` and
      must NOT advance `last_outlook_notification_at`.

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * Validation token > 256 bytes → 400 — the premise is contradicted
      by production code. The validation clause of
      `OutlookCalendarWebhookController` guards `byte_size(token) <= 256`;
      an oversize token fails the guard, falls through to the
      notification clause, and returns 202 (the
      notification-batch arm with no notifications to process). Graph
      does not treat 202 as a validation response, so subscription
      activation fails — the correct security outcome, just not a 400.

    * Outlook notification with `Oban.insert` failure →
      `last_outlook_notification_at` NOT advanced — the product
      question this was once dropped over ("heard from Graph" vs
      "successfully queued a sync") has since been settled in favour
      of the latter, matching Google, so that a run of failed inserts
      cannot read as a healthy channel. Pinned where the decision
      lives, in `webhooks_test.exs`, rather than through the
      controller: the enqueue failure is faked with `:meck` on `Oban`,
      which needs `async: false` around the module that does it.

    * Outlook lifecycle missing `subscriptionId` / `lifecycleEvent` →
      202, no enqueue — covered in
      `outlook_calendar_webhook_controller_lifecycle_test.exs` and by
      `webhooks_test.exs`, where entries without a string
      `subscriptionId` are dropped before any lookup.

    * Google webhook concurrent deliveries for same channel_id → at
      most one sync enqueued per delivery — the premise is confused.
      `GoogleCalendarWebhookController.webhook/2` has no in-controller
      deduplication; it enqueues exactly one
      `SyncGoogleCalendarWorker` per valid POST by construction. The
      interesting dedup semantics (duplicate in-flight syncs for the
      same integration) belong in Oban unique-job config, not in a
      webhook controller test.

    * Telegram webhook when `telegram_webhook_secret` is nil →
      consistent 403 — covered at `telegram_webhook_controller_test.exs`
      (nil/empty/missing/mismatched secret → 403) together with the
      `telegram_enabled?` / `shared_bot_mode?` 404 path.
