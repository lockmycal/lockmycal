defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.JsHookEventTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the JS-hook → `handle_event` seam on the
  dashboard — the class of bugs where a browser-side hook pushes a
  malformed payload to the server and the handler either crashes the
  LiveView or silently half-applies the change.

  Covers both Task 92 and Task 111. The two tasks target the same
  seam on different handlers, so they share a file:

    * Task 92 — `event_dropped` on `CalendarGridComponent` +
      `reorder_meeting_types` on `ServiceSettingsComponent`.

    * Task 111 — `event_resized`, `set_mobile_view`, and
      `navigate_swipe` on `CalendarGridComponent`.

  The production defence in each case:

    * `event_dropped` and `event_resized` both use a `with` chain on
      `Date.from_iso8601/1` + `Shared.parse_int/1` so that malformed
      strings fall through to `socket` unchanged. Regressions that
      removed any of the `with` steps (or the fall-through `else`)
      would either crash the LV or persist a bogus event move.

    * `reorder_meeting_types` filters non-integer values out of the
      payload (`nil`, `"abc"`, maps, etc.) before calling
      `MeetingTypes.reorder_meeting_types/2`; without that filter,
      the Ecto query would crash or — worse — interpret a non-integer
      as `0` and silently re-rank every row.

    * `set_mobile_view` no-ops unless the current view is `:week`;
      `navigate_swipe` maps `"next"`/`"prev"` to date arithmetic and
      falls through to the current date on any other string.

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * `event_dropped`/`event_resized` with a literal `nil` field —
      the plan asked for a "null" value, but `Date.from_iso8601/1`
      and `Integer.parse/1` both have binary-only clauses, and the
      handler reads `params["new-date"]` without a default. A literal
      `nil` would raise a `FunctionClauseError` before the `with` can
      reject it. The behaviourally interesting fall-through is the
      one the handler actually defends against: a field that is
      present but un-parseable (e.g., `"not-a-date"`, `"abc"` for an
      integer). A missing/`nil` key is contradicted by the JS hook
      contract and pinning it would lock in a crash, not a rejection.

    * `reorder_meeting_types` with a fully empty list after filtering
      (all IDs non-integer) — production runs the transaction with
      `[]`, commits nothing, and reports success. Pinning the
      "success flash on an all-invalid payload" outcome would
      entrench a minor UX inconsistency rather than document the
      invariant the handler is actually defending, which is "only
      integer IDs reach the sort_order update". A mix of valid +
      invalid IDs exercises both sides of the filter and is asserted
      below.

    * `event_resized` with negative / zero duration "rejected, no
      persist" — contradicted by production. The handler has no
      end-after-start guard; `Shared.clamp_end_time/3` only rolls
      over when `hour >= 24`. A zero-duration drag is applied
      optimistically and the final rejection happens inside the
      async provider call via `EventValidator.validate/1` at
      `event_validator.ex:37`. The behaviourally interesting input
      defence at the handler level — the one Task 111 is really
      about — is "non-numeric end-hour is rejected before the
      optimistic update fires", which is asserted below.

    * `set_mobile_view` with an "invalid view key" — contradicted by
      production. `handle_set_mobile_view/2` ignores its params
      entirely and only acts when `socket.assigns.view == :week`.
      There is no "view key" to validate. The observable no-op path
      worth pinning is "when view is already :day, the hook is a
      no-op", asserted below.

    * `navigate_swipe` with a literal missing `direction` — the
      handler pattern-matches on `%{"direction" => direction}`, with
      no catch-all clause, so a missing key would raise
      `FunctionClauseError`. The behaviourally pinnable version is
      the fall-through arm inside the case: `direction` is present
      but unknown → date unchanged. That is asserted below.
