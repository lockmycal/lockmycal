defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.AsyncHandlersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the async-task branches on the dashboard —
  `start_async`/`handle_async` pairs where the user clicks a button,
  the component kicks off a background `Task`, and a follow-up message
  drives the flash + spinner state to a final resting shape. The class
  of bugs these tests defend against:

    * An async branch that settles to `{:error, _}` but leaves the
      spinner (`is_refreshing`, `testing_connection`) stuck — the user
      sees a dead UI and thinks the operation is still running.

    * A success branch that mis-reports outcomes — e.g., "1 refreshed,
      0 failed" when both integrations succeeded, which is the
      symptom a reducer-arm bug would have.

  `calendar_settings_composition_test.exs` already pins the mixed
  success/failure arm ("1 refreshed, 1 failed"). The two extremes —
  all-success and all-failure — were untested and are the gaps closed
  here. The video `test_connection` error arm was likewise only
  covered for success, so the "button returns to enabled" invariant
  after a provider failure had no regression test.

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * Calendar refresh "stale list preserved on error" — the plan
      framed the full-failure case as "error flash + previous list
      preserved". Production calls `load_integrations/1` inside both
      success and failure arms of `handle_async(:refresh_calendars,
      …)`, so on failure the list is refreshed from the DB rather
      than preserved from the previous socket value. The assertion
      that actually matters — "the user sees an error flash and the
      refresh button becomes clickable again" — is pinned below.

    * Video "test connection" button element `disabled` assertion —
      the button is not given a `disabled` attribute while testing;
      `testing_connection` assign drives a spinner class instead. The
      behavioural surrogate asserted here is that the spinner/testing
      state has cleared, which is the user-visible "button is ready
      again" signal.
