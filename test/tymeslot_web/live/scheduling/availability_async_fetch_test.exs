defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.AvailabilityAsyncFetchTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers the availability fetch as production runs it: in a task.

  The rest of the suite runs with `:async_availability_fetch` set
  `false`, which computes the same result inline and delivers it through
  the same `{ref, result}` message. That keeps every test deterministic
  and every *downstream* step — the ref match, the loaded and error
  transitions, the landing on the first bookable day — on the production
  code path. What it cannot cover is the task itself, so this module
  turns the flag back on and drives it.

  Three things are asserted, because each fails differently:

    * the fetch genuinely runs off the LiveView process, and the booker
      still ends up on a bookable day with its times listed;
    * a calendar that errors leaves the page on the error state rather
      than a permanent spinner, with the landing attempt spent;
    * a result for a superseded fetch is discarded rather than painted
      over the window the booker has since moved to.

  The first assertion is what makes this module more than a duplicate of
  `NextAvailableTest`: it fails if the flag stops selecting the task
  path, which is exactly the regression the deterministic harness would
  otherwise hide.
