defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.RescheduleCompletionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Journey coverage for a booker completing a reschedule through the public
  scheduling page, and for what the confirmation screen lets them do next.

  What already existed was the two ends of the journey and nothing in
  between: `Tymeslot.Bookings.RescheduleTest` covers the domain function,
  and the theme meeting-page tests cover the reschedule *landing page* —
  that it renders, and that "Choose New Time" redirects to
  `/:username?reschedule_meeting_uid=…`. `DispatcherCancelCompositionTest`
  says as much in its own moduledoc: "Reschedule is not exercised here."

  The untested middle is where the bug lives. `LiveHelpers` turns that
  query param into `is_rescheduling`, `PathHandlers` has to carry it across
  every step transition, and `BookingSubmissionHandlerComponent` reads it
  back off the socket to choose between `Create` and `Reschedule`. Drop the
  param anywhere along that chain and the flow still succeeds — it just
  books a second meeting and leaves the original in place. The attendee sees
  a confirmation either way, so nothing surfaces the fault.

  Hence the load-bearing assertion in most tests below: the organiser still
  owns exactly one meeting afterwards. The exception is the "Schedule Another
  Meeting" test, which is about the opposite failure, the reschedule context
  outliving the reschedule, and so counts two.

  `RescheduleEntryTest` covers the half of the journey before the submit:
  which day the page opens on and which meeting type it offers. Both share
  `Tymeslot.RescheduleTestSetup`.
