defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.BookingSubmitCompositionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the public booking submit entry point.

  `handle_event("submit", ...)` on the theme booking components was only
  covered by happy-path + honeypot tests. This file pins the
  distinguishable error flashes that must reach the user when state
  changes between the page render and the submit — the edges that, if
  regressed, would surface as a stack trace or a generic failure flash
  instead of the specific "try again" nudges the UI promises.

  Two scenarios covered:

    * **TOCTOU slot race** — user picks a slot, an organiser event appears
      on the calendar, submit fires. The calendar pre-check must reject
      the slot and surface the "no longer available" flash. Without this
      we'd double-book silently (before fresh-check) or crash (if the
      error atom ever stops being mapped). The booker must also be bounced
      back to the schedule step with the stale time cleared — not stranded
      on the form re-submitting a dead slot.

    * **Meeting type deactivated mid-flow** — the organiser toggles a
      meeting type off while the attendee is on the form step. The
      validation layer must produce the "refresh the page" flash rather
      than a generic "please try again".

  The two other scenarios in the original audit (nil selected_date/time
  on deep-link; organiser profile deactivated) are not reachable via the
  current UI — the flow's own transition gates prevent them, and there
  is no `Profile.is_active` field. Those would require product changes
  before a meaningful regression test can exist.
