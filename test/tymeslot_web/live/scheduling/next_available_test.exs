defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.NextAvailableTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Pins the schedule step opening on a bookable day rather than an empty
  grid.

  The assertions are deliberately made against rendered output. Storing
  `selected_date` is not the feature — painting a selected day and the
  times that go with it is, and asserting only on the assign would pass
  even if no component ever received the selection.

  Three behaviours are covered, because each fails differently:

    * the common case, where today's month has a free day;
    * a month blacked out entirely, where the search has to move the
      window forward and the booker must land on a *later* month;
    * a date carried in on the URL, which is a deliberate choice and
      must survive untouched.

  The unit tests below cover the boundaries that are awkward to provoke
  through the UI — a past date sitting in the map, and a fetch that
  failed rather than returned an empty month.
