defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Scheduling.OwnerPreviewBookingTest do
  @moduledoc """
  What an owner previewing their own booking page must and must not do.

  Both properties here were broken together in issue #96, and each was
  invisible from the other end. The dashboard's "Embed & Share → Live Preview"
  built its iframe URL by hand with `?preview=true` and no token, so every
  preview booking hit the fail-closed branch and told the organiser their
  "Preview session expired" the moment they pressed Book Meeting. Meanwhile
  the gates ran before the preview-versus-real decision, so the attempts that
  were about to be refused still spent the public per-IP allowance — an
  organiser testing their page locked real visitors out of booking it.

  Fixing that surfaced the opposite fault in the sibling preview modes: Popup
  and Floating delegate to `embed.js`, whose parameter allowlist dropped the
  token, so their previews booked for real. Both directions are covered here,
  because a simulated booking and a persisted one end on the same screen and
  only the database tells them apart.
