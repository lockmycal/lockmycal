  Composition tests for `DashboardLive.handle_info/2` PubSub seams.

  Most `handle_info` clauses in `DashboardLive` are thin `send_update`
  shims that are already exercised end-to-end by the send-side tests
  (calendar integration add/delete, telegram link, profile update).
  This file pins the one path that has a real failure mode the user
  sees: the async calendar-refresh round trip when the integration has
  been deleted between the user's click and the spawned task's
  `get_calendar_integration` call.

  The failure mode we're guarding against: if the handle_info for
  `:refresh_calendar_list` (or its sibling `:calendar_list_refreshed`)
  crashed on a stale integration id, the meeting-type form would be
  left with `refreshing_calendars: true` forever — a stuck spinner the
  user can only clear by reloading the page.

  The existing `workflows_test.exs` pins the workflow-level behaviour
  (the async task sends an empty-list `:calendar_list_refreshed`
  message when `CalendarManagement.get_calendar_integration/2` returns
  `{:error, :not_found}`). This test pins the LiveView side of that
  seam:

    1. The user mounts the dashboard with a live calendar integration.
    2. The user opens the Add Meeting Type form and clicks the
       integration button — this sets `refreshing_calendars: true` in
       the form component and sends `{:refresh_calendar_list, ...}` to
       the parent LiveView, which spawns the async task.
    3. Before the async task completes, the integration is deleted
       (another tab, admin revocation).
    4. The async task finds `{:error, :not_found}` and sends back
       `{:calendar_list_refreshed, form_id, integration_id, []}`.
    5. The parent's `handle_info` must forward the update to the form
       component, clearing the spinner — not crash or leave it stuck.
