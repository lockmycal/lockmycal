  The form is the only place an organiser learns that one heading replaces a
  different sentence in each theme, and the only guard against publishing a
  half-filled introduction. Both are behaviour, not decoration.

  It also has no save button, so the switch and the text fields each have to
  persist on their own; a change that silently stops writing would otherwise
  look identical to one that works.
