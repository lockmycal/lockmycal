  @moduledoc """
  Refunding somebody else's payment.

  Ownership is a rule of the payments context: the component looks payments up
  with `MeetingPayments.get_payment_for_host/2` and refunds them with
  `MeetingPayments.refund_payment_for_host/4`, which decides ownership under
  the payment's row lock. These tests pin that the screen goes through those
  scoped paths end to end:

    * `open_refund_modal` takes an id from the client, so another host's id
      and a malformed one must both leave the modal shut without crashing.
    * `submit_refund` must read the payment from `@refund_modal_payment` rather
      than from params. The form posts a `payment_id` the handler deliberately
      ignores, and a refactor that "simplifies" the handler into trusting it
      would refund whichever payment the client names, as long as its owner
      is the one asking.
    * A payment that changes hands while the modal is open must not be
      refunded, which only a fresh, scoped read at refund time can tell.

  The second property is invisible from the outside when the code is correct,
  which is why it is tested by forging a foreign id into a submit whose modal is
  legitimately open: the refund must land on the payment the server chose.
