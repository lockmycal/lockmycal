defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.BookingsManagementCrossTenantTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Cancelling and rescheduling somebody else's meeting.

  `Meetings.get_meeting_for_user/2` loads the row first and checks ownership
  afterwards, so the guarantee lives in the caller, not in the query. Nothing
  about the markup constrains the id: the buttons are rendered from the host's
  own list, but the event carries a client-supplied meeting id, and a crafted
  socket frame can carry any id at all. These tests push exactly that frame.

  Each refusal is paired with a positive control on the same event, because a
  test that only asserts "no modal opened" passes just as well when the event
  never reached the handler.
