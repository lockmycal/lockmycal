defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.PaymentsSettingsOutstandingRefundsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The payments screen's "Refunds outstanding" card.

  The recent-payments table cannot answer this question: it shows payment
  status without meeting status, so an unrefunded cancellation looks exactly
  like a booking that is still going ahead, and its 25-row window drops older
  ones off the screen. These tests pin that a cancelled booking still holding
  the attendee's money is visible and refundable from here, that it is scoped
  to its own host, and that a row past the 60-day window says so rather than
  offering a button that would fail.
