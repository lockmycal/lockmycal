defmodule TymeslotWeb.Live.Dashboard.Availability.ListComponentCompositionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Composition tests for the availability editor's `add_break` pipeline
  — the LiveComponent → `AvailabilityInputValidation.validate_break_input/2`
  → `AvailabilityActions.add_break/4` seam.

  Existing coverage (do not duplicate):

    * `tymeslot/availability/input_validation_test.exs` — exhaustive
      unit tests for `validate_day_hours/2`, `validate_break_input/2`,
      `validate_quick_break_input/2` (valid, boundary, malformed time,
      start=end, start>end, oversized labels, zero/negative/exceeds-max
      durations, non-numeric durations). If validation logic regresses,
      those tests catch it.
    * `tymeslot_web/live/dashboard/availability_live_test.exs` —
      happy-path LiveView tests for add_break / delete_break /
      toggle-off day / clear-day.

  What was missing: the **LiveComponent → validation → form_errors →
  re-render seam**. The plan calls out several rejection variants
  (malformed time, oversized label, break spanning midnight,
  overlapping breaks); the ones reachable from the dropdown-driven UI
  are the label rule (free-text field) and the start≥end rule (the UI
  lets the user pick any two dropdown times).

  Dropped from the plan with rationale:

    * `quick_break` with empty/nil/oversized duration — no UI button
      emits the `quick_break` event today. The handler at
      `list_component.ex:210` is currently unreachable from the
      rendered template. Its input-validation rules are already
      exhaustively covered in
      `input_validation_test.exs` (`validate_quick_break_input/2`
      describe block).
    * `validate_break` errors "not silently swallowed" — the handler
      at `list_component.ex:90` deliberately swallows change-event
      errors (the UI uses time dropdowns, so change-event validation
      is logging-only; real validation runs on submit). Asserting
      against that behaviour would contradict the code's stated
      intent.
    * `validate_day_hours` with 25:00 / missing times / start≥end —
      pinned at the unit level. The LiveView's `validate_day_hours`
      handler assigns errors to `:form_errors`; no user-visible flash
      is emitted because the dropdown UI cannot produce the
      malformed shapes, so the LiveView seam adds nothing beyond
      what the unit tests already cover.

  The single remaining high-value scenario: a client bypass that
  submits `add_break` with start ≥ end must surface a form error and
  not persist a nonsensical break window — the UI uses dropdowns, but
  nothing enforces start < end client-side.

  Added after a production crash: the time dropdowns offer the whole
  day regardless of the day's working hours, so the rejections raised
  by `Tymeslot.Availability.Breaks` (outside work hours, overlapping
  an existing break) are reachable from the real UI. Those arrive as
  an `%Ecto.Changeset{}`, which the handler used to leave unmatched —
  a `CaseClauseError` that killed the LiveView instead of telling the
  organiser what was wrong.
