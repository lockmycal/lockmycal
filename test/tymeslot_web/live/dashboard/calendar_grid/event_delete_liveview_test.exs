  Deleting an event from the detail modal, end to end: the organiser asks to
  delete, confirms, the provider delete runs in the background, and the grid,
  the cache and any booking the event belonged to reflect the answer.

  The provider delete runs in a supervised Task and reaches the suite-wide
  `Tymeslot.CalendarMock`. The stub reports its call with the Task's pid, so a
  test can wait for the Task to finish instead of sleeping.
