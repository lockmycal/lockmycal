defmodule TymeslotWeb.Dashboard.CalendarGrid.EventMoveLiveViewTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Moving an event to another calendar from the detail modal, end to end: the
  organiser picks a calendar, the provider writes the move becomes, and what
  the grid and the cache show once those writes have answered.

  The provider writes run in a supervised Task and reach the suite-wide
  `Tymeslot.CalendarMock`. Every stub reports its call with the Task's pid, in
  the order the calls were made, so a test can wait for the Task to finish
  instead of sleeping.
