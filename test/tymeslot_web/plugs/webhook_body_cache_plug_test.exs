  @moduledoc """
  Covers the :body_reader plug that caches raw request bodies for
  webhook signature verification. Stripe HMAC verification (and any
  other future webhook with a signed payload) can only validate
  against the byte-exact request body — Plug.Parsers consumes it
  before the controller runs, so the raw bytes must be assigned to
  `conn.assigns.raw_body` at parse time or signature checks see an
  empty string and accept forged payloads.
