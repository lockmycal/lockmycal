defmodule Tymeslot.Repo.Migrations.EncryptAndHashLinkTokens do
  @moduledoc """
  Stops storing four link tokens as themselves:

    * `polls.token`, the poll's public voting link;
    * `poll_participants.token`, a participant's personal `?p=` link;
    * `meeting_guests.rsvp_token`, a guest's RSVP links;
    * `profiles.freebusy_token`, the free/busy feed.

  Each is shown again after it is issued (the host copies the poll link or
  the feed URL from the dashboard, every guest email rebuilds the RSVP links,
  a participant registering again gets their link back), so a hash alone
  would not do. Each token is encrypted into `*_encrypted`, and its SHA-256
  goes into `*_hash`, which the lookups use and a unique index covers. The
  hash is computed as `Tymeslot.Security.Token.hash_token/1` computes it
  (lower-case hex), and distinct tokens hash to distinct values, so the index
  meets no duplicate.

  ## The plain columns stay for now

  An image can be rolled back without this migration's `down/0` running, and
  the previous release reads and looks up only the plain columns. They are
  therefore kept, with their values, and the application stops reading them;
  the ones that were `NOT NULL` lose it so new rows can leave them empty. A
  later release, once rolling back past this one is no longer supported,
  empties and drops them.

  A kept copy must never outlive its value. Whenever a token changes (only
  the free/busy token can: it is regenerated or disabled), the same write
  empties its plain copy (`Tymeslot.Security.LegacyPlainColumn`). So under a
  rolled-back image a token issued or changed since this migration simply
  stops working, failing closed, rather than an old token the host replaced
  or disabled serving again; every untouched row keeps working.

  Encrypting needs the application's key, so the backfill calls
  `Tymeslot.Security.Encryption`, as earlier encryption backfills did. Both
  backfills only fill a column that is still empty, so running them again
  changes nothing.

  Rolling back writes each token that decrypts back into its plain column,
  over whatever that column holds, since the encrypted value is the current
  one; a token that no key opens leaves its row as it is. It then drops the
  new columns.
