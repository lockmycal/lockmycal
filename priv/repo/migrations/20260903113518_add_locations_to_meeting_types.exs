defmodule Tymeslot.Repo.Migrations.AddLocationsToMeetingTypes do
  @moduledoc """
  Gives a meeting type an ordered list of locations instead of a single mode.

  Until now a meeting type was either in-person or a video call on one
  chosen integration, expressed as the `allow_video` / `video_integration_id`
  pair. That pair stays, maintained as a projection of the list so every
  existing reader keeps working, but the list is what the booker sees: one
  entry and the location is simply stated, two or more and they choose.

  Existing types are migrated to the single-entry list that means exactly
  what they mean today, so nothing changes for a host until they add a
  second option.

  # The backfill is the point of this migration: released code reads
  # `locations` as the source of truth, so no row may reach it holding the
  # NULL that `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` leaves behind.

    # default below, which is what it effectively already was.
