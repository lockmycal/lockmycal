defmodule Tymeslot.Repo.Migrations.AddRetentionColumnsToPaymentTransactions do
  @moduledoc """
  Brings payment_transactions in line with the retention design used for
  booking_payments:
    - FK on user_id changed to :nilify_all so rows survive user deletion
    - Snapshot columns (host_email, host_name) backfilled from users
    - host_deleted_at marker for retention queries

  host_name is backfilled from users.name (the existing display-name column
  on Tymeslot.Auth.UserSchema). Both snapshot columns are nullable; rows
  whose user has no name fall back to NULL.

  ## Rollback

  This migration is irreversible. Once the :nilify_all cascade is in place,
  any host deletion nilifies user_id on existing rows. Re-adding the NOT NULL
  FK with on_delete: :delete_all would abort if any such rows exist, leaving
  the database in a broken intermediate state (index gone, columns present,
  FK partially applied). Tax-compliance data must never be silently destroyed
  by a partial rollback — raise instead so the operator can make an explicit,
  informed decision.
