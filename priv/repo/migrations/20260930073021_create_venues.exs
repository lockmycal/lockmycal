defmodule Tymeslot.Repo.Migrations.CreateVenues do
  @moduledoc """
  Saved venues: the places an organiser meets people, kept once per account
  and referenced by id from the in-person locations of their meeting types.

  `position` is the organiser's own order for their venues, set by drag and
  drop on the Locations page and used wherever venues are listed.

  `meetings.venue_id` pins which venue a booking was made at, so a reschedule
  can open on it. It is nullable and nilified when the venue goes: the
  meeting's `location` text is the record of where it was booked.

  `meetings.address_to_arrange` records that an in-person booking was made
  on a location offering no venue, so its address is arranged afterwards.
  It is stated rather than read off a nil `venue_id`, which a deleted venue
  also leaves.

  Until now an in-person location carried its address as free text in its
  `details`, retyped on every meeting type. This migration moves every
  address into a venue:

    * each in-person location with a non-blank address becomes a venue owned
      by the meeting type's owner, named after the location's label, with the
      address as its description;
    * locations with the same owner, label (ignoring case) and address share
      one venue, named with the label's casing as first seen;
    * each owner's venues are numbered (`position`) in the order their
      addresses were first seen: oldest meeting type first, then its
      locations in their stored order;
    * when one owner ends up with two different venues of the same name
      (ignoring case, as the unique index does), the later ones get the
      lowest free numeric suffix ("Office 2"), because a booker must never be
      offered two identical choices; plain names are handed out first, so an
      owner's own "Office 2" label keeps its name;
    * the location then lists that venue in `venue_ids` and its `details` is
      cleared. In-person locations without an address get an empty list and
      keep meaning "the address is arranged after booking";
    * meetings booked on a location that became a venue record it in
      `venue_id`, so a reschedule opens on it. Their `location` text is
      never rewritten;
    * in-person meetings booked on a location left listing no venue (it
      had no address) get `address_to_arrange`, which is what they were,
      unless their `location` text shows they were booked while it still
      had one.
      Every other existing meeting keeps `false`.

  Rolling back writes each location's first venue's description back into
  `details` before the table is dropped.

  The data steps are plain SQL driven from Elixir rather than the schemas,
  so the migration keeps meaning what it means today whatever the schemas
  become.

  # The table is created empty in this migration, so its unique index and its
  # reference to users cannot lock or rewrite anything. `meetings.venue_id` is
  # a new nullable column with no default; Tymeslot deploys as a single
  # instance and migrates with the app stopped, so the brief lock while its
  # foreign key and index are added is acceptable. The raw SQL is the backfill
  # and its rollback; the column and table removals are confined to `down/0`.
  # `position`'s default is part of CREATE TABLE, so it rewrites no rows.
  # `meetings.address_to_arrange` has a constant default, which PostgreSQL
  # 11 and later store in the catalogue without rewriting the table.
